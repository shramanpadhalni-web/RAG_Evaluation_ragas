Previous studies support the presence of an upper airway reflex mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of upper airway patency during sleep. We investigated the possibility that interference with this reflex mechanism contributes to the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Eight otherwise asymptomatic snorers (seven male and one female), age 39 +/- 5.3 yr (mean +/- SEM), underwent overnight sleep studies on three successive nights. An acclimatization night was followed by two study nights randomly assigned to control (C) and oropharyngeal anesthesia (OPA). On the OPA night topical anesthesia was induced using 10% lidocaine spray and 0.25% bupivacaine gargle. A saline placebo was used on night C. All subjects slept well on both study nights (mean sleep duration was 6.2 h on both study nights), and sleep stage distribution was similar on both nights. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas (OAH) rose from 114 +/- 43 during C to 170 +/- 49 during OPA (p less than 0.02). Central apneas and hypopneas (CAH) were unchanged between the two nights (8 +/- 4.9 versus 7 +/- 3). The duration of OAH was similar on both study nights (20 +/- 1.9 s during C versus 20 +/- 1.5 s during OPA). The frequency of movement arousals terminating OAH tended to be higher during OPA (7 +/- 2.9/h) than during C (3 +/- 0.7); P = NS.

       " 1: 'Neutrophil function and pyogenic infections in bone marrow transplant recipients. In a consecutive entry trial, the incidence and time course of decreased neutrophil function was assessed in 20 patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The aim of the study was to assess the prognostic value of low neutrophil function for late pyogenic infections. Chemotaxis, superoxide production, and phagocytic-bactericidal activity were studied before and 2, 6, 9, and 12 months after BMT. Skin window migration was quantitatively assessed 2 months after BMT. Infectious complications were recorded prospectively with preset criteria during 1 year. Six of the 20 leukemic patients had defective neutrophil function before BMT. Two months after BMT all 10 patients with greater than stage II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and 6 of 10 patients with less than or equal to stage II GVHD had at least one decreased function. At this time, patients with subsequent pyogenic infections had lower chemotaxis (P less than .05), phagocytic-bactericidal activity (P less than .005), and superoxide production (P less than .025) than those without. Defective skin window migration and combined defects were predictive for late pyogenic infections. At 9 months all tests were normal in seven patients surviving without GVHD. In contrast, at 9 months three of three patients, and at 1 year two of three with chronic GVHD had still decreased neutrophil function. In conclusion, neutrophil function is frequently impaired during the first months after BMT. Combined neutrophil defects predispose to pyogenic infections and indicate the patient at risk. ',\n",
       " 2: 'A phase II study of combined methotrexate and teniposide infusions prior to reinduction therapy in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. Teniposide (VM-26) can increase intracellular methotrexate (MTX) and its polyglutamate derivatives in vitro and thus has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of regimens containing MTX. In this phase II study, children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second marrow relapse were randomly assigned to receive either simultaneous (n = 11) or sequential (n = 12) continuous infusions of MTX and VM-26 prior to reinduction. Infusions of VM-26 were begun 12 hours after completion of MTX infusion in the sequential group. Dosages were individually adjusted to maintain plasma concentration levels of 10 microns for MTX and 15 microns for VM-26; total infusion times were 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Significant toxicity in the first six patients who received the scheduled 72-hour VM-26 infusion (including one drug-related death) prompted a 50% reduction in infusion duration. The reduced dose was associated with similar but more manageable toxicity. Examination of bone marrow aspirates 10 days after therapy was begun showed one complete and two partial marrow remissions; a fourth patient who had an aplastic marrow on day 10 received no further chemotherapy and had a complete remission (CR) documented on day 31. There was no obvious clinical advantage associated with either infusion schedule, although small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. The 17% response rate to the MTX/VM-26 therapeutic window in patients with refractory disease suggests the need for further investigation to evaluate alternative schedules and concomitant therapy for this drug combination.

       " 3: 'Flow cytometric DNA analysis of parathyroid tumors. Implication of aneuploidy for pathologic and biologic classification. The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis. This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms. ',\n",

A heterogeneous group of five patients with progressive, invasive angiomatous diseases including pulmonary hemangiomatosis, angiosarcoma, or massive hemangioma with associated consumptive coagulopathy were treated with interferon alfa-2a for periods of 17 to 33 months. One patient with a large thoracic hemangioma, cardiorespiratory failure, and consumptive coagulopathy died after less than 2 months of treatment. The remaining four patients have shown beneficial responses, including (1) regression of abnormal vessels on pulmonary angiogram and improved exercise tolerance in pulmonary hemangiomatosis (two patients), (2) decreased corticosteroid and/or platelet transfusion requirements in consumptive coagulopathy (two patients), and (3) decreased size and number of tumor nodules in the one patient with angiosarcoma arising in preexisting angiomatous lesions. Responses occurred during periods of 2 to 20 months of treatment. There was no measurable progression of angiomatous lesions in any patient receiving interferon at the therapeutic dose, except possibly in the one who died. Each of the four surviving patients had improved linear growth and weight gain during interferon treatment. ',\n",

The immunoreactivity for class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in Warthin's tumor (WT) cells was studied. In addition to macrophages, dendritic cells, and capillary endothelia, the luminal tumor cells and some keratinocytes in the metaplastic squamous foci exhibited immunoreactivity for both class II antigens and IL-1. The distribution of the class II antigens in the luminal tumor cells was limited to their basolateral membrane. These data, together with previous findings, strongly suggest that the luminal tumor cells of WT introduce the luminal antigen to the underlying lymphoid tissue and, thus, act as an antigen-presenting cell. \",\n",

A series of 15 consecutive children with head and neck nonorbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) with meningeal extension were prospectively treated with chemotherapy consisting of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratory, Columbus, OH) (ADM), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and dactinomycin (DACT) followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) to the primary tumor volume, along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension. ',\n",
       " 8: \"Reversibility of hepatic fibrosis in experimentally induced cholestasis in rat. The reversibility of hepatic fibrosis was investigated in an experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat after common bile duct ligation for 2 weeks, followed by bilioduodenal anastomosis for 3 weeks. Bile duct ligation resulted in a transitory marked elevation in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin during the first 3 days. Then these levels decreased to threefold, twofold, and 100-fold the normal values, respectively, during the following 4 weeks. Histologic examination of the liver disclosed extensive bile duct proliferation and the formation of periportal fibrosis, with only slight inflammation and necrosis. The distribution of the major components of the hepatic extracellular matrix was analyzed 2 weeks after bile duct ligation, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Fibrous septa were found to be strongly stained for collagens I, pro-III, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin. The most intense staining was found in enlarged periportal areas, collagen IV and laminin being particularly abundant around newly formed bile ducts. These changes paralleled high steady-state levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) collagen and B2 chain laminin mRNAs. Relief of the obstruction for 2 weeks resulted in a shift in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin toward normal values. A dramatic resorption of bile duct proliferations and periportal fibrosis were observed. Three weeks after bile duct repermeabilization, immunohistochemical study showed that the pattern of distribution of extracellular matrix components was almost normal, except for collagen IV, which remained abundant in the sinusoids when compared with the normal liver. In parallel, the steady-state B2-chain laminin mRNA level became lower than in cholestatic livers, whereas alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) mRNAs were almost undetectable. These results show that hepatic fibrosis induced by experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rat disappears in less than 3 weeks after relief of bile duct obstruction, suggesting that an active degradation of matrix protein occurs, except for collagen IV in the sinusoid. \",\n",
       " 9: 'Current status of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the examination of the abdominal vasculature. Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis. The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear. This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system. The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns. Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information. In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease of humans and various animal species that predisposes to a life-threatening, anesthetic agent-induced syndrome. MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from MH muscle have been shown to have a Ca++ release channel defect. In the present study we have tested a hypothesis that the abnormal Ca++ release mechanism in MH can be expressed when Ca++ is loaded in the presence of pyrophosphate. SR membrane vesicles isolated from normal and MH pig muscle were loaded with Ca++ in the presence and absence of pyrophosphate until Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release occurred. Under both circumstances the threshold amount of Ca++ loaded until Ca++ release occurred was lower in the SR from MH pig skeletal muscle. This difference in amount of Ca++ preload is not explained by results obtained comparing rates of Ca++ uptake, number of ryanodine binding sites or the amounts of calsequestrin among SR vesicles from MH and normal muscle. We conclude from this study that use of pyrophosphate for Ca++ loading does not ablate the abnormal Ca++ release in SR from MH muscle, suggesting the study can be done on small amounts of SR from biopsied human muscle. The data also suggest that abnormality in an intraluminal, low affinity Ca++ binding site regulating Ca++ release occurs in the SR membrane of MH pig muscle. ',\n",

We review recent cross-disciplinary experimental and theoretical investigations on metabolism of the amino acid neurotransmitters glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain during hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in central control of breathing. The roles of classical modifiers of central chemical drive to breathing (H+ and cholinergic mechanisms) are summarized. A brief perspective on the current widespread interest in GABA and glutamate in central control is given. The basic biochemistry of these amino acids and their roles in ammonia and bicarbonate metabolism are discussed. This review further addresses recent work on central respiratory effects of inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate. Current understanding of the sites and mechanisms of action of these amino acids on or near the ventral surface of the medulla is reviewed. We focus particularly on tracer kinetic investigations of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms in hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in the ventilatory response to hypoxia. We conclude with some speculative remarks on the critical importance of these investigations and suggest specific directions of research in central mechanisms of respiratory control. ',\n",

Improvement of back extensor strength (BES) can be used as a therapeutic method for patients with chronic back pain and osteoporosis. The method of evaluation must be reliable and accurate without compromising the condition of the patient. We report the development of a back isometric dynamometer (BID-2000) designed specifically by two of us to address these concerns in elderly patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. As the demographics of the general population change, increasing numbers of patients will need the type of monitoring that the BID-2000 provides. Aging has been shown to cause a reduction in the number of functional muscle motor units. To examine this effect on BES, we tested 50 normal, healthy women who were 30 to 79 years old. Proper testing of BES in patients with fragile vertebrae should include isometric measurement in the prone position, maneuverability of the device to allow comfortable positioning of the patient, and simplicity of technique to minimize repetitious performance of maximal contraction. The BID-2000 incorporates each of these features and also provides meaningful results inexpensively. The device offers a safe, reliable (coefficient of variation = 2.33%), and valid (P = 0.001) method of evaluation. The results of our study demonstrated moderate, steady reduction of BES with increasing age and with each successive decade. ',\n",

The lips of 196 patients with a history of sun-induced herpes labialis were exposed to experimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and treated with acyclovir (ACV) or placebo at different times and by different routes. Of 98 placebo recipients, 39 (40%) developed 43 lesions inside or within 10 mm of the irradiated zone. The temporal distribution of lesions was bimodal. 11 (26%) occurring within 48 h (immediate) and 32 (72%) 2-7 days after UVR exposure (delayed). Prophylactic peroral ACV begun 7 days before or 5 min after UVR prevented the development of the delayed but not the immediate lesions (P less than .001). When peroral ACV was started 48 h after UVR, delayed lesions developed but were less severe (P = .01-.05). Prophylactic topical ACV begun 5 min after UVR did not reduce lesion frequency or severity. ACV therapy can be efficacious, but some rapidly developing lesions are unresponsive to treatment. This suggests that more than one process may contribute to the pathogenesis of herpes labialis.

A newly identified myopathy of the internal anal sphincter is described. In the affected family, at least one member from each of five generations had severe proctalgia fugax; onset was usually in the third to fifth decades of life. Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized. ',\n",

The hepatitis B virus genome encodes a transcriptional transactivator protein designated HBxAg. We have investigated whether this antigen is a target structure for human T-lymphocytes. Using recombinant HBxAg protein, we found HBxAg-specific stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 6) and chronic hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 17) but not in healthy individuals. With HBxAg-specific synthetic polypeptides, several T-cell epitopes were identified. Most were located in the carboxyterminal half of the HBxAg protein. Five T-cell clones specific for a T-cell epitope located at the carboxyterminal region of HBxAg were established and found to belong to the CD2/CD4-positive, CD8-negative subtype. These data establish for the first time HBxAg as an antigen in the cellular immune response. ',\n",

The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a group of cell surface glycoproteins involved in direct cell--cell adhesion. N-CAM expression in normal and neoplastic tissues was examined with specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Most neuroendocrine cells and tumors with secretory granules expressed N-CAM protein and mRNA. Parathyroid adenomas (4) were somewhat unusual, because N-CAM mRNA, but not protein, was detected in some of these benign neoplasms. Most non-neuroendocrine cells and tumors did not express N-CAM, although uterine smooth muscle and an adrenal cortical carcinoma were both positive. Western blots disclosed proteins of 180, 140, and 120 kd in normal adult brain, whereas two pheochromocytomas, a null cell adenoma, and a gastrinoma had proteins of approximately 180 and 140 kd. These results indicate that N-CAM protein and mRNA are widely expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms. N-CAM oligonucleotide probes as well as antibodies against N-CAM can be used as broad-spectrum neuroendocrine markers. In addition, these molecular probes can be used to examine the role of N-CAM in the development and regulation of neuroendocrine tissues. ',\n",

Direct investigation of intestinal humoral immunity requires collection of intestinal secretions or mucosal biopsy specimens, or both. A non-invasive technique of gut lavage, with a polyethyleneglycol electrolyte lavage solution as a means of collecting intestinal secretions for immunoglobulin and antibody studies, was evaluated. Fifty patients were studied--25 immunologically normal patients or volunteers, 15 patients with untreated coeliac disease, and 10 patients with active Crohn's disease. Protease inhibitors were added promptly to samples to prevent proteolysis of immunoglobulin content. Treated lavage samples were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin and antibody content. Studies of serial lavage specimens showed that early, faecally contaminated specimens contained negligible quantities of immunoglobulin, but once the specimens became clear a steady state was reached, with little variation in immunoglobulin content between serial specimens and with a uniform dilution (around 20%) of the ingested polyethyleneglycol. Gut lavage fluid IgA was predominantly secretory, comprising 92%, 81.6%, and 76.7% respectively of the total IgA gut lavage fluid content in the control, coeliac, and Crohn's groups. High values of total IgM and IgA and IgM antigliadin antibodies were detected in the coeliac group, and high values of IgG in the Crohn's disease group. This method of gut lavage is not only an effective bowel cleanser, but also a noninvasive means of obtaining intestinal secretions for the study of humoral immunity in gastrointestinal disease. \",\n",
       " 23: 'Subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer in New Zealand, 1974-1983. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer within different age groups. Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974. The present study was based on 15,395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983. Subsite distribution (right colon, left colon, rectum) for different age groups (25-49, 50-69, 70+ years) was significantly skewed, with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years. This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer. Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite. Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years. This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes. There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years. In contrast, the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals. Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts.

       " 24: 'Bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated thrombolytic infusions for myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytic therapy decreases mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and is now widely used in such patients. The choice of which thrombolytic agent to use in such patients, either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is based on regional preferences. The standard dose of streptokinase is 1.5 million units over 60 min, and the dose of rt-PA that is commonly used is 100 mg over 3 h. Experiments in animals have demonstrated that rt-PA produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is both increased and accelerated and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short time period. Based on these studies, there have been a number of recent trials examining alternative dosage regimens for rt-PA (bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated) in patients with myocardial infarction. To date, there is no convincing evidence that such regimens are superior to the more traditional rt-PA regimen. Future randomized trials will determine whether attempts to optimize rt-PA regimens will result in more efficacious treatment regimens. Interest in the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute pulmonary embolism has been rekindled. The traditional 12- to 24-h regimens of streptokinase and urokinase are not optimal because of their logistic complexity and associated hemorrhagic complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that rt-PA, 100 mg over 2 h, is an effective thrombolytic agent in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. In a recent double-blind trial in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, rt-PA, 0.6 mg/kg infused over 2 min, improved pulmonary perfusion. This bolus regimen is attractive because it is simple to administer. Future studies will compare the relative efficacy and safety of these two rt-PA regimens in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. ',\n",
       " 25: 'Effects of site-specific mutations on biologic activities of recombinant human IL-6. To examine structure-activity relationships of human IL-6, we have determined the effects of specific mutations on the biologic activity of a human rIL-6 expressed in bacteria. Three types of mutants were examined: 1) a variant that contains serines in place of the four naturally occurring cysteines; 2) a series of cysteine-containing deletion mutants, each having a single internal 20 amino acid deletion; and 3) a cysteine-free variant containing a single 20 amino acid deletion. The mutants of the second type constitute a set of nonoverlapping, adjacent deletions spanning amino acids 4 through 183 of the 184 amino acids in natural human IL-6. All of the mutants were expressed, along with the full length, cysteine-containing analogue, in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins, joined to beta-galactosidase through a collagen linker. This system allows microgram quantities of the rIL-6 variants to be partially purified from small bacterial cultures without chromatographic or refolding steps. Each of the rIL-6 variants was released from the beta-galactosidase fusion protein with collagenase, and the recovered rIL-6 was quantitated by laser densitometry of Coomassie-stained, SDS polyacrylamide gels. The sp. ac. of each of the rIL-6 variants was determined using four assays: induction of IgM secretion from an EBV transformed human B cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a human hepatoma cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a rat hepatoma cell line, and induction of proliferation of a murine hybridoma cell line. Replacement of cysteines with serines reduced activity relative to cysteine-containing rIL-6 to about 20% in the rat hepatoma assay and about 3% in the mouse hybridoma assay, whereas activity in both of the human cell lines was reduced to less than 0.1%. These data suggest that the murine and rat cell lines are less selective than the human cell lines in their requirements for recognition of biologically active IL-6. Each of the deletions, except that of amino acids 4 through 23, resulted in loss of activity in all four assays. These results suggest that the information necessary for activity is not contained within any one portion of the IL-6 molecule, but rather that multiple segments of the protein are required for each of the biologic activities that we tested.

Survival after prophylactic sclerotherapy was assessed in a single-center study involving 99 cirrhotic (41 alcoholic) patients enrolled over 8-yr. The wedged hepatic vein pressure gradient was measured; those with pressure greater than or equal to 12 mm Hg were randomized to receive sclerotherapy or no treatment. The rest were not randomized. Patients in all three groups who bled were treated with emergency endoscopy and sclerotherapy. Stratification according to presence of ascites was also undertaken. Median follow-up was 61 mo (range = 14 to 107 mo). Survival among unrandomized patients was significantly longer than among randomized patients (p less than 0.006), but there was no significant difference between those treated by sclerotherapy and the controls (p = 0.27). Alcoholic cirrhotic patients undergoing sclerotherapy had better 2-yr survival than did the controls (80% vs. 43%; p = 0.09), but this benefit was not sustained at 5 yr. Survival in the nonalcoholic patient groups was identical. Only 10 of 50 deaths were caused by variceal bleeding. Forty-eight percent of patients with large varices bled, compared with 20% of patients with small varices. Wedged hepatic vein pressure less than 12 mm Hg accurately identified alcoholic patients at low risk of variceal bleeding but not nonalcoholic patients. Only four episodes of variceal bleeding were attributable to elective sclerotherapy. We conclude that in our population, prophylactic sclerotherapy alone does not improve survival. The discrepancy in survival between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients suggests that factors other than variceal hemorrhage may be responsible for the difference. ',\n",

Obese women with chronic daily headache and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, pulsatile tinnitus, history of head trauma or meningitis, an empty sella on imaging studies, or a headache that is unrelieved by standard therapy should have a diagnostic lumbar puncture. Findings from laboratory and neurologic investigations are normal in most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema. Initial management should include removal of possible inciting agents, weight loss if applicable, and standard headache therapy. Lumbar puncture and diuretic therapy should precede a trial of corticosteroids. Surgery (lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt or perhaps optic nerve sheath fenestration) may be indicated for prolonged incapacitating headache that is not responsive to medical management or lumbar puncture.

The nature of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in hospitalized children and of the associated viral agents was assessed in a study of 601 children less than 5 years old over a 24-month period. Of these children, 80% were less than 24 months of age and the ratio of boys to girls was 1.7:1. Pneumonia (86.5% of cases) was the most frequently observed clinical manifestation. Shedding of virus was detected in 21.1% of the children; the highest rate occurred in infants 0-5 months old (27%) as compared with a rate of only 12.5% in children 25-60 months old. Virus was detected in 33.3%, 32.8%, 21.2%, and 20% of the cases of tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup, respectively. Among the viruses detected, 78% were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (91% of infections with this virus occurred in children less than 2 years old) and 14.4% were influenza virus types A and B. Of the RSV infections, 61% occurred in infants less than 1 year old. The case-fatality rate was 6.8% overall and was 4.8% in virus-associated cases.

We sought to determine if failure to thrive in pediatric patients with the human immunodeficiency virus could be explained based on endocrine dysfunction. Fourteen human immunodeficiency virus-infected pediatric patients, all of whom had adequate nutritional status, underwent endocrine evaluation. Growth hormone and cortisol responses to glucagon stimulation were adequate. Despite this, eight of the 12 subjects had low somatomedin C levels. Although all patients were clinically and biochemically euthyroid, 36% (5/14) demonstrated elevated baseline and peak thyrotropin levels in response to thyroid releasing hormone, suggesting a state of compensated hypothyroidism. Although the importance of these findings is unclear, it is possible that subtle alterations of thyroid regulation may contribute to failure to thrive in some pediatric patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and may represent a potentially correctable defect.

OBJECTIVE--To determine the incidence of and risk factors for the development of secondary acute leukaemia and myelodysplasia in patients treated in British National Lymphoma Investigation's studies of Hodgkin's disease since 1970. PATIENTS--2676 Patients entered into Hodgkin's disease studies between February 1970 and November 1986. Data accrued up to November 1988 were analysed, ensuring a minimum follow up period of two years. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of multicentre trial data by case-control and life table methods. RESULTS--17 Cases of secondary leukaemia were recorded in this group of 2676 patients, giving an overall risk at 15 years of 1.7%. The risks of leukaemia after chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy with radiotherapy were not significantly different. The risk of leukaemia increased sharply with the amount of treatment given as measured by the number of attempts at treatment. The 15 year risks of leukaemia were 0.2%, 2.3%, and 8.1% for patients receiving one, two, or three or more attempts at treatment. The highest risk, 22.8% at 15 years, was observed in patients treated with lomustine (CCNU), and a case-control study suggested that this was an independent risk factor. The risk of secondary leukaemia was largely related to the overall quantity of treatment, although exposure to lomustine seemed to be an important risk factor. Treatment with both drugs and radiation was not more leukaemogenic than treatment with drugs alone. The greatest risk of secondary leukaemia was seen in multiply treated patients who were unlikely to be cured of Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS--Avoidance of secondary leukaemia should be a minor factor in the choice of treatment for Hodgkin's disease. \",\n",

For the purposes of evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the radiohalogenated thymidine analogue 125IUdR, estimation of the radiation dose to the tumour cells and normal tissues is important. To determine the dose to any tissue from the radionuclide 125I is not simple, since the major emissions are very short-range Auger electrons. The cytotoxicity of 125I is strongly dependent on the position of the decay relative to the DNA, the principal target for cell sterilization. Estimates of the cytotoxicity of 125I based on the traditional MIRD recommended formulation (ICRU Report 32, 1979) may produce gross underestimates if it is incorporated into the DNA via the thymidine precursor 125IUdR. In this work, tissue count and autoradiography (ARG) data from studies by Bagshawe et al were used to estimate tissue doses following the administration of 125IUdR to LS174/T (a colorectal carcinoma) and CC3 (a choriocarcinoma) tumour-bearing animals, after a hydroxyurea block of the normal tissue turnover. The tumour cell toxicity is estimated from ARG data on the degree of 125I incorporation into the cell nucleus. Major drawbacks with 125I for this type of therapy are the long 60-day half-life, leading to radiological and waste disposal problems and the extreme short range of the radiotoxic effects. Possible alternative radiohalogens, 13I, 77Br, 131I and 211At, are suggested in place of 125I in the thymidine analog iododeoxyuridine. Dose calculations are performed and cytotoxicities estimated on the assumption that their biological retention characteristics are the same as for 125IUdR. ',\n",

DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded trial. SETTING: A university and community emergency department. PATIENTS: Sixty-three hemodynamically and neurologically stable children. INTERVENTION: Single dose of IM MPC. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial respirations, heart rate, arterial systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and Glasgow Coma Scale were measured at 30-minute intervals. Effectiveness was assessed by two independent observers using separate visual analog scales for cooperation and sedation. Times to sleep (27 +/- 24 minutes), sitting upright (103 +/- 87 minutes), ED discharge (4.7 +/- 2.4 hours), eating (11 +/- 7.9 hours), and normal behavior (19 +/- 15 hours) were acceptable. Minor, but statistically significant, changes in respiration rate (-1.9 +/- 0.4), heart rate (+4.5 +/- 1.8), oxygen saturation (-0.7 +/- 0.3%), and Glasgow Coma Scale (-2.5 +/- 0.6) occurred for 120 minutes after MPC. No serious complications or resuscitation were required. Mean visual analog scale scores were 5.0/10.4 or more in 71% of cases, with interobserver agreement very good (cooperation, r = .79; effectiveness, r = .80).

Twenty-six evaluable children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who failed to achieve initial remission after receiving two to seven drugs for at least a 4-week period were given teniposide (VM-26) and continuous infusion cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Twenty-two received 150 mg/m2 of VM-26 on days 1 and 2 with 100 mg/2 of Ara-C as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5; a second shortened course was given on day 14 to eight patients who had evidence of some antileukemic effect or were clinically judged able to tolerate a second course. The last four patients received three daily doses of VM-26 and a 7-day infusion of Ara-C at the same daily dosages. Twelve (48%) achieved complete remission (CR) of ALL. There was a trend toward decreasing response rates with an increasing number of drugs used in the initial induction regimen, i.e., five CR among seven patients with a prior two-drug induction attempt, six CR among 14 patients with a prior three- to four-drug induction attempt, and one CR among four patients with a prior five- to seven-drug induction attempt (P = 0.14). Ten of 17 non-T-cell patients and two of nine T-cell patients achieved remission (P = 0.10). The median time required to achieve a complete remission from the initiation of treatment was 26 days (range, 14-72 days). This period was shorter in those who required one course compared with those who required two induction courses, i.e., 25 days median vs. 44 days median. Toxicity was significant and due mainly to marrow aplasia and infection; one patient had severe prolonged VM-26-induced hypotension. Of the 12 patients entering remission, two were removed for marrow transplant and one was removed due to parental request. In the remaining nine patients, median remission duration was only 2 months (range, 1-18 months). All nine patients relapsed in the marrow. Among the entire group of 26 patients, only one patient is alive and a long-term event-free survivor (after allogeneic marrow transplant). Due to the current use of more aggressive initial induction regimens and the extremely poor prognosis in children who fail to achieve initial remission, more intensive regimens of continuation therapy or alternative therapies, such as bone marrow transplant, should be considered.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary calcium and sodium on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive rats (Wistar, WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl rats and on calmodulin (CaM) activator, a newly-discovered hydrophobic compound that increases CaM activity in SHR and spontaneously hypertensive mice (SHM) tissues (J Clin Invest 82:276, 1988). The CaM activator was assessed by its capacity to stimulate a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE). In Wistar rats, which were fed a high sodium diet (3.5%), BP significantly increased (P less than .01) from 106 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 8 mm Hg in parallel to an elevation of the CaM activator from 1.57 +/- 0.14 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 U. WKY, SHR, and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats were given low (0.15%) or high (2.5%) Ca diets, both with 1% sodium. In rats receiving high dietary Ca the progression of hypertension diminished and BP was lower in SHR (156 +/- 4 mm Hg) and young DS/JR rats (125 +/- 3 mm Hg) than in those receiving low dietary Ca (192 +/- 10 and 183 +/- 2 mm Hg). There was a concomitant decrease of CaM activator in these animals to levels indistinguishable from those of WKY or DR/JR rats. The activator was also found in the heart, kidneys and erythrocytes from SHM.

Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration. ',\n",

The ratio of phosphomonoester to adenosine triphosphate peak intensities (PME/ATP) was unusually large in all tumors studied. The average PME/ATP in lymphomas (1.8 +/- 0.5) was greater than in nonlymphoma cancers (1.1 +/- 0.15). The average PME/ATP for all tumors studied (1.4 +/- 0.5) was much greater than that of underlying skeletal muscle (0.23 +/- .09). Eight of the tumors were studied before and after therapy. Responders were distinguished from nonresponders on the basis of changes in tumor size. PME/ATP decreased during therapy in three lymphomas that responded to therapy. In an adenocarcinoma and Ewing sarcoma that did not respond to therapy, PME/ATP increased. PME/ATP remained constant in two squamous cell carcinomas that responded to therapy and decreased in one squamous cell carcinoma that decreased in size by 40% but was classified as a nonresponder. Changes in PME/ATP did not always parallel changes in tumor size during therapy. In two patients, a decrease in PME/ATP preceded a decrease in tumor size.

We tested 11 patients with multiple sclerosis for the presence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)- or type II (HTLV-II)-related sequences. DNA from blood mononuclear cells was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction utilizing three different oligonucleotide primer pairs. Two of these primer pairs detect sequences shared between HTLV-I and HTLV-II in either p24, gag protein, or in p21, env transmembrane protein. The third primer pair was synthesized based on regions in the pol gene where amino acid sequences are conserved between HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the related bovine leukemia virus. The multiple sclerosis samples were consistently negative while appropriate control samples were positive. We conclude that viruses related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or bovine leukemia virus are not present in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and, therefore, that HTLV-bovine leukemia virus-related viruses are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial. \",\n",

The mean change in percent area stenosis among controls was +0.80, indicating progression, while the mean change for the treatment group was -1.53, indicating regression (P = .039 by two-tailed t test for the difference between groups). Regression among women, analyzed separately, was also significant. The change in percent area stenosis was correlated with low-density lipoprotein levels on trial. We conclude that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels can induce regression of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The anticipation of benefit from treatment applies to women and men alike. ',\n",

Cancelling an operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is not always feasible or practical. Yet we know very little about the additional risk posed by a URI occurring in a child undergoing anesthesia and surgery. Using a large prospectively collected pediatric anesthesia database, we studied 1283 children with a preoperative URI and 20,876 children without a URI. We found that children with a URI were two to seven times more likely to experience respiratory-related adverse events during the intraoperative, recovery room, and postoperative phases of their operative experience. Although these children also experienced significant disruptions in temperature regulation, they were not at risk for any other deleterious events. The elevation in risk after URI as compared with children without a URI was not explained by differences in age, physical status scores, surgical site, and emergency or elective status. However, if a child had a URI and had endotracheal anesthesia, the risk of a respiratory complication increased 11-fold (95% confidence intervals 6.8, 18.1). We conclude that the administration of general anesthesia to children with a URI is not benign and that these children require more observation/management in all perioperative phases of their surgical procedure.

Urinary continence with a Kock or Mainz pouch is achieved by a nipple valve of the invaginated ileum which is usually fixed with metal staples. However, metal staples can cause various complications as a foreign body. The seromuscular stripping method, a new technique to create a nipple valve, was applied to 17 patients with bladder cancer in the construction of a continent urinary reservoir by the ileocolonic pouch (Mainz pouch). Metal staples were not used. The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other. Histology of the nipple valve from an autopsy case showed a good double layer nipple valve that functioned well to preserve continence. ',\n",

Transpulmonic pressure gradient and pulmonary artery pressures can be estimated from the Doppler pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation. In this study, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography was used to assess changes in pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities associated with administration of vasodilators in 10 patients with congestive heart failure. M-Mode echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimension and fractional shortening did not change with administration of vasodilators. Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity at end diastole decreased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 m/sec (p less than 0.01), and Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole decreased from 16 +/- 11 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole was compared with catheterization-determined pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure before and after administration of vasodilators in three patients, and there was a good agreement between these measurements. Thus noninvasive and sensitive assessment of the effect of vasodilators on pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure in patients with congestive heart failure is possible with continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities.

Clustered (CD23, 25, 39, 40, 27, 1c, w75) and unclustered (NuB1, 7F7, KiB3) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were tested. Almost all cases showed high reactivity to CD23, 27, w75, 39, 40, and NuB1: expression of CD1c was very low and that of 7F7, KiB3, and CD25 was variable. The reactivity of 7F7 and KiB3 was strictly correlated, and they correlated individually with CD25. Results show that the most frequent B-CLL phenotype (CD19+, 5+, 23+, 27+, 39+, NuB1+, KiB3 +/-, 7F7 +/-, and CD25 +/-) corresponds to one or more cellular subsets in the mantle zone. No correlation was found between MoAb expression, surface immunoglobulin (SIg) class or type, clinical stage, disease activity, or age at diagnosis. The only difference (statistically borderline) was the expression of 7F7 and KiB3 (in young versus old patients). This suggests that modulations in the expression of surface antigens do not affect the clinical behavior of the disease. ',\n",

The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents.

We describe the successful treatment and follow-up of a patient with refractory ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock with percoronary chemical ablation. After endocardial mapping was used to identify the \"tachycardia-related\" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents \"backwash\" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death. The only complication of this procedure was temporary third-degree AV block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. ',\n",

Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension. While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS. Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events. Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant. Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety. Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature. Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage.

All 240 consecutive cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that underwent autopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between September 1962 and August 1986 were reviewed. Among these cases, 162, for which photographs of cut surfaces of the primary tumors were available, were grossly classified using a combination of both Eggel's classification and our own into three major types, i.e., nodular, massive, and diffuse as described by Eggel (Eggel H, Beitr Pathol Anat 1901; 30:506-604), and three subgroups of nodular type, i.e., single nodular type (type 1), single nodular type with extranodular growth (type 2), and contiguous multinodular type (type 3) by our classification (Kanai T et al., Cancer 1987; 60:810-819). Seventy-eight cases were classified as nodular type, comprising seven cases of type 1, 61 cases of type 2, and ten cases of type 3. Sixty-seven and 17 cases were classified as massive and diffuse type, respectively. Of the 78 nodular-type tumors, 59 measured less than 10 cm, whereas 64 of 67 massive-type tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The incidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor spread of HCC was significantly higher for tumors measuring more than 5 cm. As to the relationship between macroscopic type and tumor spread, the frequency of spread was lowest for type 1 tumors, and high for the other types. Intrahepatic metastasis was detected in 28.6% of type 1, 93.4% of type 2, 100% of type 3, and 98.5% of massive-type tumors. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 24.6% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 38.8% of massive-type and 52.9% of diffuse-type tumors. Hematogenous extrahepatic metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 47.5% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 74.6% of massive-type and 82.4% of diffuse-type tumors.

There were no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed miners in reported diagnoses of neurological disorder; however, exposed miners performed less well than did unexposed workers on cognitive state examinations; also, the proportion of men with scores in the impaired range was greater in the exposed than non-exposed group.

OBJECTIVE: To date, there have been no formal investigations of neuropsychological performance in patients with Tourette's disorder who are taking psychotropic medications. The authors conducted this study to provide such information. METHOD: They examined the neuropsychological performance of 96 patients 6-18 years old who met DSM-III-R criteria for Tourette's disorder; 51 of these patients were taking neuroleptic medications and 45 were not. The groups were well matched with regard to age, sex, education, and duration of symptoms. Each group was given a complete neuropsychological test battery as well as instruments rating symptoms of Tourette's disorder, obsessive-compulsive characteristics, and other behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: The patients taking medications did not differ from those not taking medications on any of the neuropsychological, intellectual, or educational measures. In addition, the groups did not differ with regard to level of Tourette's disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that patients with Tourette's disorder who do not experience intolerable side effects from neuroleptic medications are able to perform on educational, intellectual, and neuropsychological tests at a level comparable to that of unmedicated patients. These results have positive implications for patients with Tourette's disorder who respond to neuroleptic medications. \",\n",

The sensitivity of the isolated, perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM). A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine. The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response. No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine. These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term, high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure.

Infarcted myocardium shows an increase in integrated backscatter and loss of cardiac cycle-dependent variation in backscatter. The cyclic variation of backscatter is closely related to regional myocardial contractile function; the latter is a marker of myocardial ischemia. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intramural cyclic variation of backscatter can map and estimate infarct size. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmural myocardial infarction was produced in 12 anesthetized, open-chest dogs by total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 hours. A real-time ultrasonic tissue characterization instrument, which graphically displays integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5, cardiac cycle-dependent variation, and patterns of cyclic variation in backscatter, was used to map infarct size and area at risk of infarction. Staining with 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and Patent Blue Dye was used to estimate infarct size and the area at risk, respectively. The ratio of infarct size to area at risk of infarction determined with UTC correlated well with that determined with TCC (r = 0.862, y = 23.7 +/- 0.792x). Correlation coefficients for infarct size and area at risk were also good (r = 0.736, y = 12.3 +/- 737x for infarct size and r = 0.714, y = 5.80 +/- 1.012x for area at risk).

The CYBEX II isokinetic dynamometer was used in the measurements. On an average of 8 yr after the injury, the mean strength deficit of the injured knees was minimal: 4 +/- 5% (range 0-28%) in extension and 2 +/- 4% (0-20%) in flexion. The average strength score (max. 100 points) was 90 +/- 11 (56-100), representing an excellent classification. In hamstrings, the relative strength deficit increased significantly with a higher speed of isokinetic movement (P less than 0.05). Compared with the strength parameters (peak torques), the other functional parameters of the injured knees (total work, average power, and peak torque acceleration energy) showed some but not significantly greater deficits (hamstrings 9-11%, quadriceps 6-8%). In conclusion, the general thigh muscle function in knees with old second-degree sprain of the medial ligament compartment appears good and acceptable, but the strength deficits are systematically greater in higher speeds of isokinetic movement.

Therefore, we studied the effect of these mediators on the cholinergic responsiveness of isolated human airway segments. Lung tissue collected at thoracotomy from 30 patients was studied. Dose-response curves to MCh were obtained from bronchial segments before, during, and after incubation with either a subthreshold or a threshold concentration of histamine (10(-10) or 10(-8) M), the stable TxA2 analogue U46619 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M), PGD2 (5 x 10(-9) or 5 x 10(-7) M), PGF2 alpha (10(-9) or 10(-7) M), or LTC4 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M). With the exception of LTC4, the presence of any of these mediators at either concentration increased the sensitivity to MCh by a factor of 1.1 to 2 (p less than 0.05, ANOVA). This increase did not depend on the dose of the mediator (p greater than 0.05, ANOVA).

Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (MEP) were examined in 33 patients within three days after stroke. Normal values for MEP and motor central conduction time (CCT) were obtained in 46 healthy controls whose MEPs were evaluated during slight voluntary muscle contraction and at rest. Two months later 23 patients were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically. Motor function change was correlated with MEP results. Two months after stroke the patients with normal or prolonged CCT had an improved motor function compared with those with absent CCT. MEP may be a valuable prognostic indicator in the acute stage of paralytic stroke for recovery of motor function. ',\n",

Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be influenced by many factors. Therefore, 137 patients in whom paired radionuclide angiograms were obtained within 24 h of acute infarction and before hospital discharge were retrospectively evaluated to determine which factors most affect improvement in ejection fraction. Only baseline ejection fraction correlated significantly with improvement in ejection fraction by both univariate analysis (ejection fraction as a continuous variable; p less than 0.001; ejection fraction as a categorical variable, less than or equal to 45% versus greater than 45%, p less than 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p less than 0.0001). Reperfusion status (patent versus occluded infarct artery) and extent of coronary artery disease (one, two or three vessel) were significant factors by multivariate but not by univariate analysis. Location of infarction, treatment modality and time to treatment did not correlate with change in ejection fraction by either statistical technique. Thus, of those factors tested, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is the most potent predictor of improvement in ventricular function after acute infarction. Knowledge of baseline ejection fraction may be helpful in deciding whether to treat some patients with equivocal indications or contraindications for reperfusion therapy. Clinical trials of reperfusion strategies should stratify patients on the basis of baseline ejection fraction if ejection fraction is to be used as an end point for myocardial salvage. ',\n",
       " 79: 'Vascular renin and hypertension. Uptake versus synthesis. Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin. Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin. Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message. In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure. Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate. It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis. These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions. ',\n",

Two hundred and fifty patients undergoing elective surgical treatment involving anastomoses of the left side of the colon or colon and rectum have been studied in a randomized trial in which the EEA (U. S. Surgical Corp.) circular stapler has been compared with single layer sutured anastomoses. Only patients in whom either technique was feasible were included in the analysis. The operative techniques were largely standardized. Patients were studied by means of a limited barium enema on the ninth or tenth postoperative day. The data have been analyzed for leakage rate (clinical and roentgenologic), other complications and degree of experience of the surgeon. Eleven patients were excluded from the analysis because the selected technique could not be carried out; of these, eight were in the stapled group in which it was possible to perform a sutured anastomosis. There were no instances in which it was possible to staple but not possible to suture. The remaining three exclusions were patients in whom either a coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure was performed. There was no over-all difference in the leakage rate--roentgenologic, clinical or total--between the two groups. However, when analyzed by the surgeon, the clinical leakage rate for surgeons in training was greater for sutured anastomoses than for stapled anastomoses (p = 0.053). Thus, it appears that the benefits of experience are more pronounced for sutured anastomoses but that, in experienced hands, neither technique is superior. ',\n",

To study alterations in host defense mechanisms that enhance pneumococcal virulence, a model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia was developed in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis, with or without ascites, was produced in rats by intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Histopathologic and laboratory studies demonstrated that CCl4-induced cirrhosis was similar to alcoholic cirrhosis in humans. Cirrhotic rats were more susceptible to type 3 pneumococcal pneumonia induced by intratracheal challenge than controls, and the presence of ascites was associated with the lowest LD50. More cirrhotic rats with ascites had bacteremia and elevated levels of circulating capsular antigen after challenge compared with cirrhotic rats without ascites or controls. Pulmonary clearance of pneumococci was markedly reduced in rats with cirrhosis and ascites and was associated with reduced serum complement levels. This model may be useful in further studies of the pathogenesis and therapy of pneumococcal infections in the compromised host. ',\n",

To determine whether latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) occurs after infection, 27 infants with acute bronchiolitis were studied and compared with 15 hospital controls. Blood was collected for whole blood challenge, and histamine release was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography technique with fluorometric detection. There was a significantly greater histamine release to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) in those with bronchiolitis than in controls, expressed either in amount (median 154 nmol/l compared with 104 nmol/l) or percentage release (median 20% compared with 3%). There was a significant difference between index and control groups in terms of individual histamine responses. These findings strongly suggest that infants develop latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) during the course of acute bronchiolitis. Serial lung function tests were performed in 15 infants. All infants had abnormalities of lung function at some stage, but the small numbers of subjects precluded comparison between 'sensitised' and 'non-sensitised' infants. Further study is indicated to define the relation of latent sensitisation and subsequent bronchial hyper-responsiveness after respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants. \",\n",

Several autoimmune sera from patients with Raynaud phenomenon decorated mammalian kinetochores and bound to a 47-kDa protein on immunoblots of nuclear lysates. Antibody affinity-purified from immunoblots of the 47-kDa band recognized kinetochores, but due to crossreaction with an 18-kDa protein, localization remains elusive. We used one of these sera to purify the antigen from HeLa cells synchronized in mitosis as a noncovalent complex with a 25-kDa protein. The antigen was released from DNA by intercalation with 25 mM chloroquine. Ion-exchange chromatography yielded the pure complex with an apparent molecular size of 68 kDa, which was separated into its components by gel filtration in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the 47-kDa protein gave two main spots of pI 6.6 and 6.7, respectively. Posttranslational modification is indicated by additional antigenic spots, by lack of a free alpha-amino group, and by chromatographic behavior of peptides on reversed-phase chromatography. The amino acid sequence for 205 residues of the 47-kDa protein has been established. This sequence is highly homologous with the translated reading frame of RCC1, a gene reportedly involved in regulating onset of mammalian chromosome condensation. ',\n",

To determine whether the neuroprotective properties of phenobarbital would alter the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, we randomly assigned 110 women at less than 31 weeks of gestation to receive 10 mg/kg phenobarbital or placebo in a blinded fashion before delivery. Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups. We conclude that antenatal administration of phenobarbital appears to be effective in decreasing the severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants delivered at less than 31 weeks of gestation.

The APACHE II severity of disease classification system has been examined prospectively in 160 patients with acute pancreatitis. Using clinical and simple laboratory data APACHE II was able to provide useful discrimination between uncomplicated, complicated and fatal attacks within a few hours of admission. Peak APACHE II scores (recorded during the first 3 days) had a prognostic accuracy similar to the multiple factor scoring systems, but then incurred a similar delay. Patients could be graded according to their risk of death or of developing a major complication; no deaths occurred in patients with a peak APACHE II score less than 10. APACHE II can be repeated daily, uncomplicated attacks demonstrating falling scores in association with clinical improvement, in contrast to the rising scores associated with clinical deterioration in those dying early. APACHE II appears to reflect any continuing disease activity and may prove a useful means of monitoring the course of the illness and response to therapy. ',\n",

Our studies showed that in an appropriate dose, nimodipine increased local cerebral blood flow with no corresponding increase in local metabolism. Nimodipine treatment given before experimental ischemic insult, resulting from either vascular occlusion or intracranial hemorrhage or after subarachnoid hemorrhage, maintained or improved blood flow and minimized the severity of subsequent brain damage. Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult. Our findings are compatible with the benefit of nimodipine being due to an improvement in blood flow that reduces the severity of ischemia. However, they do not exclude the possibility that treatment may minimize the accumulation of calcium in damaged cells as a result of \"cytoprotective\" effects. ',\n",

We have examined the pathophysiological role of readmission of oxygen (and hence production of oxygen-derived free radicals) in the initiation of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias by separating, on a temporal basis, readmission flow from readmission of oxygen. Isolated rat hearts (n = 12/group) were subjected to 10 minutes of regional ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion. In controls reperfused with oxygenated solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg), 92% of hearts developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the first 20 seconds of reperfusion, whereas in hearts reperfused with hypoxic solution (Po2 9.3-12.2 mm Hg), the incidence of VF was only 17% (p less than 0.05). Subsequent readmission of control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) to the latter group led, within 20 seconds, to the appearance of VF in seven of the 10 hearts (70%) that had not previously fibrillated. To examine whether hypoxic reperfusion had prevented VF or merely delayed its onset, the studies were repeated in separate groups of hearts with the duration of hypoxic reperfusion extended to 5 minutes. In addition, to examine the partial pressure dependence of the relation, the Po2 in the reperfusion solution was set at one of five different levels: greater than 600, 150-192.7, 69-85.6, 9.2-14.8, or 0.0 mm Hg. It was found that hypoxia merely delayed VF onset by 20-40 seconds and did not significantly reduce the incidence of VF, which was 83%, 92%, 67%, 58%, and 58%, respectively. This indicated that readmission of oxygen is unnecessary for the initiation of VF during reperfusion. The hearts that reverted to sinus rhythm during the ensuing 5 minutes (n = 8, 4, 5, 9, and 8, respectively) were used to assess the arrhythmogenic consequences of readmission of oxygen. When control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) was readmitted, new episodes of VF were elicited within 20 seconds in a manner that was inversely proportional to the preceding Po2 (p less than 0.05), the incidence of new episodes of VF being 0%, 0%, 40%, 67%, and 86%, respectively. The arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was not the result of a sudden increase in heart rate, because a similar arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was seen in separate groups of hearts that were paced (350 beats/min) throughout hypoxia and readmission of oxygen. In conclusion, readmission of flow and readmission of oxygen are independent determinants of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). ',\n",

Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.

Also evaluated was the effect of interleukin 2-interferon alfa therapy on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity as well as total lymphocyte count, percent of lymphocyte subsets, and levels of both circulating immune complexes and antibody classes. Both the percent and absolute number of natural killer cells (ie, CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes) within peripheral blood as well as natural killer cell activity against K562 targets increased significantly with treatment.

The methodology addresses four important components of the analytic process: (1) the criteria that must be satisfied for a clinical practice to be considered effective; (2) proper methods for reviewing evidence from published clinical research to determine whether a clinical practice meets these criteria (including methods for performing comprehensive literature reviews, for judging the quality of individual studies, and for synthesizing or pooling the results of multiple studies); (3) theoretical and practical concerns in translating the results of the scientific review into sound clinical practice recommendations; and (4) the importance of documentation, guidelines, and other safeguards to minimize the effect the reviewers themselves have on the objectivity and consistency of the analytic methods.

Twenty five patients had attacks accompanied by headache, and seven gave a history of common migraine. Only four of 27 angiograms were abnormal; no operable carotid lesion was demonstrated. Over a mean follow up period of 10 years stroke or myocardial infarction (AMI) occurred in all four patients who presented major cerebrovascular risk factors, but in only two of the remaining 42 patients. Thus irrespective of age thromboembolic TIA is a harbinger of stroke or AMI. However, most TIAs under the age of 40 years are caused by a non-embolic benign vascular disorder.

The systems included a Spacelabs Alpha 14 Model Series 3200 ECG Cardule at bandwidths of 0.05-125 Hz and 0.5-30 Hz (a typical operating room monitor), a Marquette Electronics MAC II ECG at 0.05-40 Hz and 0.05-100 Hz (a standard ECG), and a Del Mar Holter recorder at 0.1-100 Hz. Relative ST-segment position and incidence of new ischemia compared to the preoperative ECG were determined in 109 sets of preinduction traces and 877 sets of intraoperative traces. ST-segment position on the three recording systems conforming with the American Heart Association (AHA) low-frequency response recommendations (0.05 Hz) were similar. Compared to the standard ECG, ST-segment position on the Spacelabs at 0.5-30 Hz was consistently more negative. Displacement on the Holter was consistently less negative and less positive.

Normal and immune mice were evaluated for their ability to resist infection to the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, during pregnancy. Parasitemia levels were slightly higher and time-to-death shorter in the nonimmunized pregnant group infected with virulent parasites relative to virgin controls. Subinoculation experiments revealed that numerous virulent organisms were present in the placentas of unprotected gravida but were absent from the fetal livers of their conceptuses. It was also found that mice preimmunized with irradiated P. yoelii survived a usually lethal challenge infection during mid-gestation and delivered healthy newborns. Associated with this protection against transplacental spread of parasites was the additional key finding that placental macrophages were as effective as peritoneal exudate cells in phagocytosing parasite derived material in vitro. This murine malaria-pregnancy model should provide new insights on the various factors (virulence, immunogenicity) of microbial infections affecting the fetal-maternal relationship, as well as on the expression of immune effector mechanisms and immunoregulation, during the reproductive process.

Rapid increase in hemispheric concentration of these substances was noted beginning shortly after trauma. This trend continued until they were about three to four times control levels by about 24 to 48 hours postinjury. In the spinal cord, however, there was an initial sharp reduction in regional concentrations 2 hours postinjury followed by a slow rise thereafter. By 48 hours postinjury, levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin of the cords of injured animals were still less than those of nontraumatized controls. This variation in the central nervous system bioaminergic response with the level of injury raises questions as to its precise role in neurological damage following mechanical insult. ',\n",

Supravalvar aortic stenosis is associated with normal systolic pressure in the aorta and its branches with the singular exception of the coronary arteries, which are hypertensive. This uncommon lesion has been treated by patch aortoplasty of several types. We examined hemodynamics and morphometrics in 13 patients who underwent operation for supravalvar aortic stenosis from 1979 through 1988. They ranged in age from 2 to 43 years (mean age, 14.5 +/- 3.8 years [+/- standard error of the mean]). There were no operative deaths. Preoperative and postoperative (1 to 5 years) catheterization or echocardiography or a combination of these was done in all but 3 patients (1 died late suddenly without a postmortem examination; 1 was lost to follow-up; and 1 has not yet been restudied). Pressure gradients across the stenosis in patients treated with a single-sinus patch (n = 4) were 65 +/- 18 mm Hg preoperatively and 5 +/- 3 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.05) and in patients with a bisinus patch (n = 6), 83 +/- 15 mm Hg preoperatively and 6 +/- 2 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.05); the two groups were not significantly different. Measurements of the diameters of the coronary arteries, aortic annulus, and descending aorta were made, and calculation of the ratio of the coronary artery and annulus diameters to the descending aortic diameters both preoperatively and postoperatively was possible in 5 patients. The left coronary artery was larger than normal before and after operation. Preoperatively there was a disproportionate increase in left coronary artery and annulus size during systole. Left ventricular wall thickness decreased significantly postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis (localized and diffuse) by both single sinus and bisinus patch repair is safe and hemodynamic results are good. ',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate women's psychological responses to abnormal mammograms and the effect on mammography adherence. To identify psychological responses and other factors that predict mammography adherence in women with normal or abnormal mammograms. DESIGN: Survey study with prospective analysis of factors associated with mammography adherence. SETTING: Health Maintenance Organization of Pennsylvania and New Jersey (HMO PA/NJ). PATIENTS: Study patients, members of HMO PA/NJ who were 50 years of age or older, and who had had mammography done 3 months earlier, included women with normal mammograms (n = 121), women with low-suspicion mammograms (n = 119), and women with high-suspicion mammograms (n = 68), but not women with breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS: Psychological responses 3 months after mammography and adherence to subsequent annual mammography were assessed. MAIN RESULTS: Women with high-suspicion mammograms had substantial mammography-related anxiety (47%) and worries about breast cancer (41%). Such worries affected the moods (26%) and daily functioning (17%) of these women, despite diagnostic evaluation excluding malignancy. For each variable, a consistent trend (P greater than 0.05) was seen with degree of mammogram abnormality. Sixty-eight percent of women with normal results, 78% of women with low-suspicion results, and 74% of women with high-suspicion results obtained their subsequent annual mammograms (P greater than 0.05). The number of previous mammograms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and the effect of the previous results on concerns about breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.5; CI, 0.2 to 1.0) were independent predictors of adherence in logistic regression analyses (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with suspicious mammograms have psychological difficulties, even after learning that they do not have cancer. Such sequelae do not appear to interfere with subsequent adherence. \",\n",
       " 112: 'Influence of age and endocrine factors on the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia. To determine whether endocrine factors influence the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 23 hormonal factors were measured in the serum of 64 men ages 42 to 71 years with low volume prostatic cancer and these levels were correlated with the volume of benign hyperplastic tissue in their radical prostatectomy specimens. With age there was a significant increase in the volume of BPH. Also with age there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandronsterone (DHA), dehydroepiandronsterone sulphate (DHA-S), delta 5-androstenediol, and 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and a significant increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, and FSH. When BPH volume and hormone levels were corrected for age, BPH volume correlated positively with free testosterone, estradiol, and estriol. These data indicate that with age patients with larger volumes of BPH have higher serum androgen and estrogen levels suggesting that serum androgen and estrogen levels may be factors in the persistent stimulation of BPH with age. If so, therapeutic attempts at lowering plasma testosterone levels, reducing estrogen levels, or blocking androgenic stimulation through other mechanisms may interfere with the progression of BPH with age. Conversely, the fact that androgen production declines gradually with age may explain the observation that only 20 to 30% of men who live to age 80 require surgical treatment for urinary obstruction from BPH.

DNA-synthesis rates and concentrations of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) progenitor cells were studied in 22 patients treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL3) as part of a clinical phase I/II study. Recombinant hIL3 at doses of 60 to 500 micrograms/m2 was administered by subcutaneous bolus injection for 15 days to 13 patients with solid tumors and preserved hematopoietic function and to nine patients with bone marrow failure, including five with myelodysplastic syndromes. Following treatment with rhIL3, the percentage of actively cycling BM erythroid (BFU-E) and multilineage (CFU-GEMM) progenitors in patients with preserved hematopoietic function increased from 16% to 36% (P less than .05) and from 10% to 40% (P less than .01), respectively. The DNA-synthesis rates of early and late granulocyte macrophage progenitor cells increased from 11% to 26% (CFU-GM day 14; P less than .02) and from 13% to 30% (CFU-GM day 7; P less than .05). There was an increase in BM cellularity from 37% to 58%, and of the myeloid to erythroid ratio from 1.4 to 3.2, while the concentration of marrow progenitors on a per cell basis was unchanged or slightly decreased. The frequencies of blast cells in the BM were unchanged. Mean levels of PB CFU-GM day 14 and CFU-GEMM were 100% and 72% above baseline values after 7 days of rhIL3 but only 25% and 28% above initial levels at the end of treatment. Peripheral blood BFU-E were reduced in the majority of patients with normal marrow after both 7 and 15 days of rhIL3. No augmentation of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GEMM was seen in 5 patients with MDS who had few or no PB BFU-E or CFU-GEMM initially. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts increased significantly (P less than .01) in 21 of 22 patients with a peak response after a median of 13 days of rhIL3. While a small increase in reticulocytes was not accompanied by an elevation of the hemoglobin or hematocrit, platelet counts increased by 50% in patients with preserved marrow function. Thus, rhIL3 induces a multilineage response in vivo, apparently by stimulating proliferation of multipotential and lineage-restricted progenitors. It remains to be determined whether this is due to direct or indirect effects on the progenitor cells. ',\n",

In a 21-month period, 70 episodes of SBP were diagnosed according to our criteria in 60 cirrhotic patients. Both culture methods were performed simultaneously. The conventional grew bacteria in 40 episodes (57%), whereas the modified grew bacteria in 54 episodes (77%), a significantly higher sensitivity (p = 0.0001). In 16 cases (23%), ascitic culture was negative by both methods. The mortality rate was higher among patients with culture-positive SBP than those with culture-negative SBP (46% vs 37%), but did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that ascitic fluid inoculated into a TSB blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside should be used routinely for ascites culture in cirrhotic patients. \",\n",

A case of extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm associated with an unusually tortuous portal vein is described. Real-time ultrasonography showed anechoic masslike lesions at the porta hepatis communicating with the superior mesenteric vein and intrahepatic portal branches. This suggested the presence of two saccular portal vein aneurysms, 27 x 21 mm and 21 x 13 mm in size. Magnetic resonance imaging and portal venography confirmed the portal vein aneurysms and an unusually tortuous portal vein curving caudally between them. The liver was histologically normal and there was no evidence of portal hypertension. It is speculated that these portal vein aneurysms may have been congenital and that the associated tortuous portal vein might have been secondary to hemodynamic changes in the portal venous system.

Research on mapping diabetes-susceptibility genes is dependent on several factors, including the existence of a single major gene for susceptibility, genetic homogeneity, and the existence of appropriate clinical material. The power to detect susceptibility genes is dependent on the risks in relatives and the distance of genetic markers from the susceptibility genes. For insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), the best-fitting risk models are those with a single major locus with residual polygenic factors. The major locus effect is likely represented by genes in the HLA complex, because specific genotypes have been found to affect IDDM risk significantly. Thus, mapping the remaining polygenic IDDM susceptibility factors--each of small effect--is a difficult and long task. For non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the likely risk models result in few genes with moderate effect. Models of NIDDM have significant residual polygenic variation remaining, reflecting the importance of multiple loci with small effect, environmental effects, or genetic heterogeneity; however, the prospects for mapping genes that provide at least moderate susceptibility for NIDDM now appear promising.

An increasing number of chronic pain treatment outcome studies have appeared in the literature. In general, these studies support the efficacy of multidisciplinary pain programs, as well as specific treatment modalities such as biofeedback and relaxation. Reviews of this literature have tended to be cautiously optimistic. Some concerns, however, have been raised about the methodological adequacy of these studies, particularly in terms of the lack of control groups, the brief duration of follow-up periods, and the vague criteria used for establishing the success of the therapeutic interventions. Other factors that mitigate conclusions regarding the generalizability of the favorable results reported need to be considered. In this paper 3 rarely discussed topics that are implicit within most treatment outcome studies and that need to be given greater attention are examined. These topics include: (1) referral patterns to pain clinics (who are referred to pain clinics, when, and how representative is the referred sample?); (2) failure to enter treatment (e.g., exclusion criteria, lack of available financial support to cover the cost of treatment, patient's refusal to accept recommendations), and consequently, the representativeness of the treated sample; and (3) patient's attrition. In this paper we discuss each of these factors as they underscore important qualifications that have to be made in evaluating treatment outcome studies. \",\n",

Three patients (25%) died of tumor recurrence and three (25%) died of other causes. Unifocal and intrahepatic tumors were associated with better prognosis compared to the multifocal tumors and tumors with extrahepatic spread (p = 0.04 and 0.13). Microscopically vascular invasion and the predominance of embryonal and/or anaplastic epithelium were associated with a poor prognosis compared to the tumors with no vascular invasion and with predominantly fetal epithelium (p = 0.08 and 0.1).

To assess the relation between increases in contractile function and oxygen consumption (VO2) during increased coronary flow (Gregg's phenomenon), we measured the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the relation between VO2 and left ventricular systolic pressure-volume area (PVA, a measure of total mechanical energy output) in blood-perfused, isovolumically contracting rabbit hearts during control and intracoronary adenosine infusion. During adenosine infusion at a constant perfusion pressure (93 +/- 11 mm Hg), coronary flow increased by 99 +/- 76% (p less than 0.01), and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Emax (ventricular contractility index), increased by 18 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01). When compared at the same left ventricular volume, PVA increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) and VO2 by 19 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) with adenosine. The VO2-PVA relation was linear under each condition (both median r = 0.98). With increased coronary flow, the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation (unloaded VO2) increased by 22 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) without a change in the slope; that is, a parallel upward shift was observed, indicating that the contractile efficiency (energy conversion efficiency of the contractile machinery) remained constant. These increases in Emax and unloaded VO2 were not eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. We conclude that increased coronary flow with adenosine at a constant perfusion pressure augments both Emax and the nonmechanical energetic cost for excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism via nonadrenergic mechanisms, without changing contractile efficiency. \",\n",

To assess the impact on the management and safety of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the elderly population, the results and limitations of this technique were retrospectively analyzed in 88 patients. TEE was indicated whenever the transthoracic approach was not diagnostic or was inconsistent with the clinical setting. The most frequent clinical indications were to investigate the source of emboli, assess valvular regurgitation, and identify valvular vegetations. In 72 patients (82%) TEE significantly influenced management decisions. In selected patients TEE avoided the use of more invasive diagnostic procedures. Adverse effects included occasional premature atrial or ventricular beats (11 patients), sinus bradycardia (six patients), and protracted nausea (one patient). We conclude that in elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases, TEE plays a significant role in the decision-making process without adding a significant risk. ',\n",

Eighteen men with symptomatic coronary artery disease, exercise-induced ischemia and minimal symptoms, underwent 4 blinded treatment periods of 2 weeks' duration (2 placebo, 1 atenolol, 1 nifedipine). Those that did not have ischemia eliminated by monotherapy received combination therapy with both drugs. Forty-eight-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was used to quantitate ischemic parameters at the end of each period. Both nifedipine and atenolol as monotherapy reduced the number of ischemic episodes and the average duration of each episode compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced the total duration of ischemia (p less than 0.05) but the effect of atenolol on ischemia duration was of borderline significance (p = 0.066). There were no differences in reduction of ischemic parameters when atenolol was compared with nifedipine (difference not significant). In the 9 patients who continued to have ischemia with monotherapy, combination therapy eliminated it in 2 and reduced the duration by greater than 50% in the remaining patients compared with placebo. In conclusion, monotherapy with nifedipine or atenolol is similarly effective in eliminating or reducing ambulant ischemia. Combination therapy can provide additional benefit in those with continued ischemia. \",\n",

Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, classroom work output, laboratory measures of attention and learning, and direct observations of social behavior. Improvement with medication on the Conners Hyperactivity Index was observed in 75% of subjects. Significant increases in work output, on-task behavior, and attentional skills were associated with methylphenidate. However, gains in measures of attention were not associated with improvement in learning, as measured by a paired associate learning task.

The inhibitory activity of PQQ was more potent than that of idebenone, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in all the three assay systems. In the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction, PQQ had no effect on the formation of uric acid at the concentration of CL inhibition. These results suggest that PQQ might have a radical scavenger-like activity. Structure-activity relationship of PQQ and its six related compounds showed that the 7- and 9-carboxyl groups of PQQ as well as the orthoquinone structure are responsible for the radical scavenger-like activity. In addition, the -NH group in the pyrrole ring of PQQ seemed to be essential for the antilipid peroxidative activity in the rat brain homogenate. When administered i.p., PQQ inhibited the development of 0.1% carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats.

These findings suggest that microvascular EnC in primary B cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract lack a property as antigen-presenting cells, and that HEV are involved in the migration of non-neoplastic T lymphocytes.

Serum alpha-tocopherol concentration was studied for its prediction of cancer in a cohort of 36,265 adults in Finland. During a mean follow-up of 8 y, cancer was diagnosed in 766 persons. The levels of serum alpha-tocopherol were determined from stored serum samples (at -20 degrees C) taken from these cancer patients and from 1419 matched control subjects. Individuals with a low level of alpha-tocopherol had about a 1.5-fold risk of cancer compared with those with a higher level. The strength of the association between serum alpha-tocopherol level and cancer risk varied for different cancer sites and was strongest for some gastrointestinal cancers and for the combined group of cancers unrelated to smoking. The association was strongest among nonsmoking men and among women with low levels of serum selenium. The findings agree with the hypothesis that dietary vitamin E in some circumstances protects against cancer. ',\n",

The authors used cine magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping to study flow in the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) of 13 healthy control subjects and 13 patients with right-sided cardiac disease. In the control subjects, peaks of flow in systole and diastole were observed, and mean SVC flow was 35% of the cardiac output. Respiratory gating was used in six control subjects to acquire images at end inspiration and end expiration, and although the systolic peak was reduced at end expiration, total flow was unchanged. A reduced systolic peak and retrograde flow in the IVC were observed in patients with tricuspid regurgitation. A reduced diastolic peak was seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, pericardial constriction, and right ventricular dysplasia, reflecting reduced diastolic compliance of the right ventricle. In the patient with obstruction of the SVC, absence of flow was confirmed, and retrograde flow was seen in the azygos vein. The authors believe that cine MR velocity mapping is a reliable method of studying vena caval flow noninvasively and that it has important potential applications for the investigation of disorders of the right side of the heart.

Nine patients with complete quadriplegia underwent external striated sphincter stenting with the Wallstent in place of an external striated sphincterotomy. Although suprapubic catheters were placed to provide an outlet should problems develop with the stent, they were successfully removed within 6 weeks in all but 1 patient. Complete bladder emptying with reduced voiding pressures was achieved, together with a significant reduction in the duration of hyper-reflexic contractions. Epithelialisation of the stent was almost complete within 3 months and intermittent catheterisation or endoscopy (and resection) is possible through the stent. Although this is a preliminary report of this new technique, it is hoped that sphincter stenting will provide a rapid, safe and effective method of treating high pressure hyper-reflexia and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in quadriplegic patients.

Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care. Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home. Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death. No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours. From this experience we conclude that, although \"optimal\" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die. Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable.

To test the prognostic value of plasma renin activity prospectively, we determined the pretreatment renin-sodium profile of 1717 subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age, 53 years; 36 percent white; 67 percent men) in a systematic work-site treatment program. METHODS. Renin profiles, obtained by plotting plasma renin activity against the urinary excretion of sodium, were classified as high (12 percent of the subjects), normal (56 percent), and low (32 percent), and there were expected variations according to age, sex, and race. Modified stepped-care treatment for hypertension, prescribed without reference to the renin profile, was similar in the three renin groups. RESULTS. Mean (+/- SD) blood pressure at entry was 151 +/- 19/100 +/- 10 mm Hg in the subjects with a high renin profile, 151 +/- 19/97 +/- 10 mm Hg in those with a normal profile, and 151 +/- 20/96 +/- 11 mm Hg in those with a low profile. During 8.3 years of follow-up, there were 27 myocardial infarctions. As adjusted for age, sex, and race, the incidence of myocardial infarction per 1000 person-years was 14.7 among the subjects with a high renin profile, 5.6 among those with a normal profile, and 2.8 among those with a low profile (rate ratio for high vs. low, 5.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 8.3). The rate of mortality from all causes was 9.3 in the high-profile group, 5.3 in the normal-profile group, and 3.9 in the low-profile group. The independent association of a high renin profile with myocardial infarction (but not with stroke or noncardiovascular events) was affirmed by Cox analyses (rate ratio for high vs. normal plus low, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.4) after adjustment for race, sex, age at entry, serum cholesterol level, smoking status, electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, blood glucose level, body-mass index, history of cardiovascular disease or treatment, blood pressure, and use of beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS. In the study population, whose blood pressure before and during treatment was in a narrow range, and after other cardiovascular risk factors had been considered, the renin profile before treatment remained independently associated with the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction.

The goals of treatment of the Budd-Chiari syndrome are relief of portal hypertension, relief of inferior vena cava syndrome, if present, and preservation of hepatic function. This study presents a patient with clinical resolution of the Budd-Chiari syndrome after placement of expandable metallic stents in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A 26-year-old man with severe ascites and lower extremity edema but with relatively preserved hepatic function had a small gradient across a suprahepatic caval web, large gradients across an intrahepatic caval stenosis and the left hepatic vein, and an occluded right hepatic vein. Under angiographic control, web and caval stenosis were balloon-dilated, and modified Gianturco expandable metallic stents were placed in the intrahepatic vena cava. The left hepatic vein was dilated twice and a stent was placed. All gradients were completely eliminated. There were no complications and after 1 year, the stents have fully expanded without migration, edema and ascites have resolved, hepatic function has normalized, and the patient has returned to work. This new technique provides a simple, safe, effective, relatively inexpensive, and potentially long-lasting treatment for selected patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome. ',\n",

To determine whether obesity alters responsiveness to vasoactive drugs, we compared the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin, phenylephrine and isoproterenol in unanesthetized age-matched control and obese Oscai rats. Obesity was induced by programming pups to overeat immediately after birth and then feeding them a high-fat diet thereafter. Elevations in tail-cuff systolic and mean pressures from 7 through 11 months of age and in plasma insulin at 8 months of age indicated that obese rats had developed borderline hypertension and hyperinsulinemia. Cardiovascular responsiveness was then tested by recording blood pressure, heart rate and renal blood flow from chronically implanted arterial catheters and flow probes while graded doses of the three test drugs were infused intravenously. Heart rate and renal blood flow decreased during pressor responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine and were oppositely increased during depressor responses to isoproterenol. Magnitude of all cardiovascular receptors was dose-dependent. Obese rats had weaker reflex bradycardic responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine than control rats. More importantly, they also had larger renal vasoconstrictor responses to 2 ng/100 g of angiotensin or vasodilator responses to 15 ng/100 of isoproterenol. Whether or not the changes in cardiovascular responsiveness were related to hyperinsulinemia was undetermined. Our results suggest that, in addition to being overweight, slightly hypertensive and hyperinsulinemic, obese Oscai rats have impaired baroreflexes and a renal vascular bed more responsive to beta adrenergic vasodilation.

Anorectal function was evaluated in 11 patients with voiding dysfunction due to multiple sclerosis. In six patients with constipation, three also had symptoms of obstructed defecation and one patient was incontinent due to stercoral diarrhea. One patient was only fecal incontinent and one patient had obstructed defecation as the only symptom. Three patients had no anorectal symptoms. Anal manometry in the women compared with a control group revealed significant lower anal resting and squeeze pressures, although no significant difference of rectal sensation to distention with air was found. Pudendal nerve terminal latencies were obtained in seven patients and were all normal. In four patients latency could not be demonstrated due to poor contraction of the sphincter on stimulation of the pudendal nerve. Two of these patients were incontinent and two had both constipation and obstructed defecation. It is concluded that patients with voiding symptoms due to multiple sclerosis often reveal anorectal symptoms or motility disorders. Although anal sphincter function is reduced, fecal incontinence is not prevalent in this group. The reason for this lies probably in the fact that many of the patients are constipated, thus securing fecal continence. ',\n",

The authors describe a patient with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection, and review 14 additional cases reported in the English-language surgical literature. The diagnostic triad of pneumoperitoneum on x-ray, evidence or history of CMV infection, and AIDS occurred in 70 percent of patients. The most common site of intestinal perforation was the colon (53 percent), followed in frequency by the distal ileum (40 percent) and appendix (7 percent); perforation usually occurred between the distal ileum and splenic flexure of the colon. Colonoscopy, rather than sigmoidoscopy, is recommended as a screening examination in patients with AIDS suspected of having colonic ulceration due to CMV infection. Multiple biopsies of ulcerated tissue should be obtained. Gross and microscopic analyses of involved intestinal tissue reveal the characteristic findings of ulceration and CMV infection. Despite aggressive therapy, the operative mortality rate in patients with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection was 54 percent and the overall mortality rate was 87 percent. Postoperative complications occurred in most patients and consisted mainly of systemic sepsis and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii infection. An increased awareness of this syndrome by physicians frequently called on to manage patients with AIDS is recommended. ',\n",

Extended ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in the patient's customary environment provides clear evidence of circadian patterns in myocardial ischemic episodes. In patients with effort angina, the highest activity occurs between 6 AM and noon. This coincides with peaks in diurnal variation of frequency of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death. A number of potential underlying common triggering mechanisms, including catecholamine secretion, sympathetic nervous system activity, blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol secretion, and aggregability of platelets, exhibit similar surges. As a result of these coinciding morning peaks, myocardial oxygen demand is increased and oxygen supply reduced after a person arises in the morning. Attention to this vulnerable period is merited in the timing and choice of medication, both to prevent or reduce ischemia and to modify potential disease-triggering mechanisms. \",\n",

The ratio of ankle-to-arm systolic blood pressure (ankle/arm index or AAI) appears to be a non-invasive indicator of flow-significant atherosclerosis and may be a useful measure of burden of disease in a high risk population. The prevalence of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) was assessed by this method in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). Subjects were aged 60 and older with systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg upon entry to the study. An AAI of 0.90 or less was considered indicative of flow-significant LEAD. The prevalence of LEAD by this method was 26.7% (50/187), while the prevalence of intermittent claudication (IC) was only 6.4% (12/187). Of those with IC, 66.7% (8/12) had confirmed LEAD. The prevalence of LEAD as measured by AAI increased with age in women and was associated with a history of current smoking and lower levels of high density lipoproteins. In this study population with systolic hypertension, LEAD, as measured by the AAI, is more prevalent than previously described in elderly populations and is associated with other risk factors for atherosclerosis.

Strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with deletions of the small RNA (EBER) genes were made by homologous recombination using the EBV P3HR-1 strain, which has undergone deletion of the essential transforming gene that encodes the EBV nuclear antigen, EBNA-2, and a DNA fragment that was wild type at the EBNA-2 locus but from which the EBER genes had been deleted. Even though the EBER and EBNA-2 genes are separated by 40 kilobases, selection for transforming P3HR-1 recombinants that required a restored EBNA-2 gene resulted in 20% cotransfer of the EBER deletion. EBER-deleted recombinants transformed primary B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which were indistinguishable form LCLs transformed by wild-type EBV in their proliferation, in latency-associated EBV gene expression, and in their permissiveness for EBV replication cycle gene expression. EBER-deleted virus from infected LCL clones could infect and growth-transform primary B lymphocytes. These procedures should be applicable to the construction of other EBV recombinants within 40 kilobases of the EBNA-2 gene.

In all cases the endoprostheses expanded to a diameter of 7 to 10 mm and achieved complete biliary tract drainage. Jaundice disappeared in 36 of the 39 patients. No early complication was observed. After a median follow-up of 121 days (range, 30 to 422 days), 19 of 36 patients are still alive and 17 died of non-procedure-related causes. Biliary re-obstruction occurred in five patients due to tumor overgrowth above or below the prosthesis (four patients) or bile encrustation (one patient).

The epithelial cells of the stomach and duodenum are normally protected from the damaging effects of acid and pepsin by a balancing mechanism of mucosal resistance. If an imbalance occurs, peptic ulcer may result. Traditional teaching has emphasized the importance of acid (and pepsin) as the cause of this imbalance; however, it is clear that acid and pepsin are not the only important factors in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer. More recent investigative efforts have been directed at what constitutes mucosal resistance and how it can be disrupted to produce, in the presence of gastric acid, a peptic ulcer. Depletion of endogenous prostaglandins and Helicobacter pylori gastritis have emerged as prominent theories. As evidence exists both to support and refute these theories in humans, any definitive conclusions cannot be made at this time. The acute management of peptic ulcer disease is directed at relieving pain, accelerating ulcer healing, and preventing complications. Peptic ulcers can be healed with antisecretory agents (i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, omeprazole), antacids, prostaglandins, and sucralfate. Because they are effective, safe, and convenient, the H2-receptor antagonists are the most widely used agents for the management of peptic ulcer disease. Because the H2-receptor antagonist agents are equally effective in their indicated uses and are equally safe based on scientifically valid data, selection should be based primarily on cost. Omeprazole is the newest antisecretory agent: a single morning dose of 20 mg suppresses acid secretion for 24 h. The agent offers little advantage over H2-receptor antagonists for the majority of patients with peptic ulcer. ',\n",

Serum for LH measurement was drawn every 15 minutes during 8 hours of EEG telemetry in both groups. The 2 groups did not differ significantly in average mean baseline LH secretion, total LH secretion, or average pulse amplitude. The group with seizures, however, showed a significantly greater (p less than 0.05) variability of baseline LH secretion and pulse frequency. Among the men with unilateral paroxysmal EEG findings, pulse frequency was significantly greater (p = 0.05) with right epileptiform discharges or left slowing (6.4 +/- 0.4) than with left epileptiform discharges or right slowing (3.0 +/- 1.3). The relationship of pulse frequency to the nature and laterality of paroxysmal discharges makes it unlikely that endocrine abnormalities can be attributed to medication alone and strengthens the notion that temporal lobe epileptiform discharges may disrupt hypothalamic regulation of pituitary secretion.

A vitrectomy and a membrane peeling were attempted, and specimens of the retina, the retrolental membrane, and a vascularized epiretinal peripheral mass were examined by light and electron microscopy. The retrolental membrane was composed of layered collagenous tissue and contained structures resembling blood vessels. Inner and outer neuroblastic layers were identified in the retinal tissue, but no vessels were present. In the epiretinal mass, portions of retina and cortical vitreous were seen along with primitive vascular structures. The histologic appearance of these specimens suggests that the major pathologic event of Norrie's disease occurs in the retina in the third to fourth gestational month. We believe the subsequent ocular abnormalities found in this patient were secondary to this early retinal malformation and did not represent a progressive ocular disorder. \",\n",
       " 163: 'General principles of therapy of pyogenic meningitis. In bacterial meningitis, several pharmacodynamic factors determine therapeutic success-when defined as sterilization of the CSF: (1) Local host defense deficits in the CNS require the use of bactericidal antibiotics to sterilize the CSF. (2) CSF antibiotic concentrations that are at least 10-fold above the MBC are necessary for maximal bactericidal activity. Protein binding, low pH, and slow bacterial growth rates are among the factors that may explain the high antibiotic concentrations necessary in vivo. (3) High CSF peak concentrations that lead to rapid bacterial killing appear more important than prolonged suprainhibitory concentrations, probably because very low residual levels in the CSF prevent bacterial regrowth, even during relatively long dosing intervals. (4) Penetration of antibiotics into the CSF is significantly impaired by the blood-brain barrier and thus, very high serum levels are necessary to achieve the CSF concentrations required for optimal bactericidal activity. Beyond these principles, recent data suggests that rapid lytic killing of bacteria in the CSF may have harmful effects on the brain because of the release of biologically active products from the lysed bacteria. Since rapid CSF sterilization remains a key therapeutic goal, the harmful consequences of bacterial lysis present a major challenge in the therapy of bacterial meningitis. Currently, dexamethasone represents that only clinically beneficial approach to reduce the harmful effects of bacterial lysis, and novel approaches are required to improve the outcome of this serious infection.

The 36 symptomatic episodes that occurred in 33 patients included fever in 20 episodes and fever combined with cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or rales in 16. Fourteen chest roentgenograms were interpreted as normal, and 22 were interpreted as demonstrating nonspecific changes; however, none of the roentgenograms was considered helpful in that they did not provide sufficient information for further management. In 2 of 14 episodes in patients with normal chest roentgenograms and in 9 of 22 episodes in patients with nonspecific chest roentgenograms, CT scanning resulted in a change in clinical management that included performing bronchoscopy, increasing or changing antibiotic coverage, starting white blood cell transfusions, requesting surgical biopsy, or a combination of these. In 1 of 14 episodes in patients with normal chest roentgenograms and in 8 of 22 episodes in patients with nonspecific roentgenograms, CT added confidence to the diagnosis. In the remaining 16 episodes, CT scans provided no additional information. We conclude that in many instances, noncontrast ultrafast chest CT scans can provide information that may either change a patient's clinical management or more clearly establish the extent of pulmonary disease. \",\n",

Overdistraction was maintained from 5 to 30 minutes after loss of NMEPs. Results suggest that the longer the duration of overdistraction the greater the likelihood of paraplegia. Blood flow measures indicated that reduced perfusion was greatest at the distraction site but extended proximally and distally. Finally, NMEPs were more sensitive to onset of overdistraction and a more valid indicator of paraplegia than SEPs. NMEPs should provide the surgeon with more time for initiation of intervention techniques than SEPs. Because NMEPs and SEPs provide information regarding different spinal cord tracts, the authors continue to use both methods for monitoring the functional integrity of the human spinal cord during corrective spine surgery.

Prostheses were divided into four zones: head (including acetabulum), trochanter, shaft, and tip. The presence (or absence) and intensity of activity in each zone was noted, and compared to the corresponding contralateral zone. Though present in all 23 infected arthroplasties, periprosthetic activity was also present in 77% of uninfected arthroplasties, and was greater than the contralateral zone 51% of the time. When analyzed by zone, head zone activity was the best criterion for infection (87% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 92% accuracy). Fifty of the arthroplasties were studied with combined labeled leukocyte/sulfur colloid imaging. Using incongruence of images as the criterion for infection, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the study were 100%, 97%, and 98%, respectively. While variable periprosthetic activity makes labeled leukocyte imaging alone unreliable for diagnosing hip arthroplasty infection, the addition of sulfur colloid imaging results in a highly accurate diagnostic procedure.

Dysphagia is a potentially important symptom, often leading to the finding of an anatomical or motility disorder of the esophagus. Dysphagia and heartburn represent two of the most common symptoms associated with esophageal motility disorders. To explore the relationship of symptomatic esophageal dysphagia and heartburn and their association with primary esophageal motor disorders, we have performed a retrospective assessment of 1035 patient evaluations performed at our gastrointestinal laboratory. A clear statistical association of symptomatic dysphagia and heartburn was established; however, no pattern diagnostic of a specific motility disorder was discernible. A sizable fraction of our patient population with dysphagia demonstrated normal esophageal motility. A significant portion of dyspeptic patients exhibited both normal motility and acid exposure. The differences observed between the incidence of subjective symptoms and objective dysfunction may be explained in part by an altered or increased esophageal sensitivity of these patients. ',\n",

Emergency ventricular shunting led to prompt neurological improvement, which, supplemented by radiation therapy, allowed long-term amelioration of symptoms. Three possible explanations for this complication are offered: 1) traction of the attached 3rd ventricle into the decompression site, causing increased obstructive hydrocephalus, 2) vasopressin release by surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and circumventricular organs causing cerebral edema, and 3) edema in the residual tumor secondary to surgical manipulation causing further hydrocephalus.

In an effort to explain the increased sensitivity to agonists of hypertrophic vascular muscle, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)-signaling mechanisms were studied in normal and hypertrophic rat aortas from normotensive and coarctation-hypertensive rats. Based on both fura 2 fluorescence and aequorin luminescence measurements, qualitatively different patterns of Ca2+ mobilization occur in normal and hypertrophic rat aortic muscle. Normal rat aortic muscle contracts to phenylephrine with little or no increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas the angiotensin II-induced contraction is accompanied by a marked [Ca2+]i transient. In contrast, hypertrophic rat aortic muscle shows a dramatic increase in Ca2+ signaling after phenylephrine stimulation. Moreover, both the amplitude of the angiotensin-induced [Ca2+]i transient and the contractile sensitivity to this agonist are decreased in the hypertrophic muscle. Our results strongly suggest that the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient after agonist stimulation determines the contractile sensitivity and that there is an altered coupling of the alpha-adrenoceptor in the hypertrophic vascular muscle.

In a multivariate regression analysis of age, location, tumor stage, and preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, the latter three factors were significant prognostic variables with respect to the adjusted survival. Recurrent disease was found in 42% of patients, excluding patients with stage IV disease. The carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was greater than 5 ng/mL in 79% of the patients and in 89% of the intra-abdominal recurrences. Carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was not predictive of postrecurrence survival except in the subgroup of locoregional disease. The life span in patients with liver and lung metastases was not influenced by carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence. Preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels can indicate a poorer prognostic group of patients with colorectal cancer who may benefit from adjuvant treatment.

Susceptibility difference in T cells of various phenotypes and functions and its relevance to immunosuppression in the tumor-bearing state. The present study investigates the nature of humoral component(s) generated in tumor-bearing hosts to induce immune dysfunction of T cells. Cell-free ascitic fluid and culture supernatant (SN) were obtained from the ascites and cultures allowing MH134 hepatoma cells to grow. These ascites and SN samples were tested for their abilities to influence the generation of CTL responses to TNP and alloantigens. The generation of the anti-TNP CTL responses that require self H-2-restricted CD4+ Th cells was markedly suppressed by addition of the ascites or SN under conditions in which these samples did not inhibit anti-allo CTL responses capable of using alternate pathways of allo-restricted CD4+ and CD8+ Th. The activation of CD8+ CTL precursors and CTL activity were also resistant to the ascites or SN. The ascites- or SN-induced suppressive effect to which CD4+ Th were most susceptible was found to be mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activity, because: 1) the TGF-beta activity was detected in the MH134 ascites and culture SN; 2) the suppression of CD4+ Th function required for anti-TNP CTL responses was almost completely prevented by addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody to cultures and; 3) rTGF-beta also induced similar patterns of immunosuppression to those observed by ascites or SN. These results indicate that TGF-beta produced by tumor cells induces deleterious effects on T cell, especially on the CD4+ Th subset, and provide an explanation for the molecular mechanism underlying the previously observed CD4+ Th-selective suppression in the tumor-bearing state.

Accordingly, a randomized, three period, placebo-controlled, crossover (Latin square) design was used to determine the effect of atenolol and diltiazem on time and frequency measures of heart period variability calculated from 24 h continuous electrocardiographic recordings during treatment with atenolol, diltiazem and placebo in 18 normal volunteers. During atenolol treatment, the 24 h average normal RR (NN) interval increased 24% (p less than 0.001). The three measures of tonic vagal activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment: percent of successive normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms = 69%, root mean square successive difference of normal RR intervals = 61% and high frequency power in the heart period power spectrum = 84%. Low frequency power also increased 45% (p less than 0.01), indicating that this variable also is an indicator of tonic vagal activity over 24 h. Diltiazem had no significant effect on the 24 h average NN interval or on any measure of heart period variability. The decreased mortality rate after myocardial infarction associated with beta-adrenergic blocker but not calcium channel blocker therapy may be attributed in part to an increase in vagal tone caused by beta-blockers.

       " 200: 'The differentiation of delayed serologic and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions: incidence, long-term serologic findings, and clinical significance. Delayed serologic transfusion reactions (DSTRs) and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) were studied in a large tertiary-care hospital. A DSTR was defined by the posttransfusion finding of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and a newly developed alloantibody specificity. A DHTR was defined as a DSTR case that showed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Thirty-four cases of DSTR, 70 percent of which were due to anti-E and/or -Jka, were documented prospectively over a 20-month period. Retrospective review of the medical records found clinical evidence of hemolysis in only 6 (18%) of the 34. Thus, the incidence of DSTR was 1 (0.66%) of 151 recipients with posttransfusion samples available for testing, whereas the incidence of DHTR was only 1 (0.12%) of 854 patients tested. Fifteen of the 34 patients were followed for up to 174 days after reaction. Twelve of the 15 still demonstrated a positive DAT with anti-IgG only. Eluate studies indicated that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR may involve several immunologic mechanisms, including the development of posttransfusion autoantibodies. This study indicates 1) that DSTRs are a frequent finding in multiply transfused patients, although most cases are benign and fail to meet rigid criteria for DHTR, and 2) that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR is common.

Congenic mouse strains were tested in the lymphocyte proliferation assay for their response to the purified surface protease of Leishmania mexicana (gp63). The data obtained allow us to distinguish three different patterns of response, influenced both by H-2 (class II) and non-H-2 genes. Mice of the C57BL/10 (B10) background carrying H-2 haplotypes b,q, and r were found to be high responders; those carrying H-2 haplotypes d, j, v, and z were low responders; and those with H-2a, H-2f, H-2k, H-2p, and H-2u haplotypes were intermediate responders. Studies with H-2 recombinant strains indicated that the high responsiveness on the B10 background was determined by the Ab allele and the low responsiveness influenced by the Ad allele. Other genes besides H-2 appear to have a role in the immune response as shown by the fact that some strains with BALB, DBA, or C3H background differed in their pattern of responsiveness from B10 background strains carrying the corresponding H-2 haplotypes. By using recombinant protein, the influence of the leishmanial surface lipophosphoglycan that might co-purify with gp63, on the MHC restriction of the response to gp63 was excluded. The immune response to gp63 did not correlate with susceptibility of mouse strains to cutaneous infection with L. mexicana promastigotes. ',\n",

The present study was designed to verify the attentional performance of patients with parietal lesions in the experimental condition in which they had to pay attention to 3 spatial positions located on the left, on the right and directly above the fixation stimulus (Experiment 1) and to only 1 of the 3 spatial positions at a time (Experiment 2). Twelve patients (6 subjects with right parietal lesions and 6 subjects without neurological deficits) participated in the experiment. The results of Experiment 1 showed that in patients with right parietal lesions the speed and accuracy of response to horizontally aligned stimuli increased gradually from right to left, whereas the control group showed only the effect due to the different retinal eccentricities of the 3 stimuli, that is, responses to central stimuli were faster and more accurate than responses to left and right stimuli. The results of Experiment 2 showed that both the neurological and control groups were faster to respond to central than to left and right stimuli, and that the neurological group was faster to respond to right than left stimuli, whereas no difference in RTs between two visual fields was obtained in the control group. Furthermore, when the patients had to respond to 3 spatial locations aligned horizontally (Experiment 1), the speed and accuracy of response to the right stimulus were the same as when they had to focus attention on it (Experiment 2). These results showed that the focus of attention in patients with visual extinction is on the rightmost stimulus and that the increased attention to the right is accompanied by a decreased attention to the left.

Striatocapsular infarction has recently been described as a distinct stroke entity and forms an important subgroup of subcortical infarctions. In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis.

There were 22 women and 3 men, with a mean age of 51 +/- 14 years (range, 27 to 74). Hemodynamic and angiographic findings were evaluated before and after PMV and clinical status was assessed at follow-up. There was a significant decrease in mitral gradient following PMV, from 15.4 +/- 5.1 to 5.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (p less than .0001); an increase in cardiac output, from 4.6 +/- 1.1 to 5.2 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than .01); and an increase in calculated mitral valve area, from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.2 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p less than 0.0001). Mitral regurgitation developed or increased in severity in six patients (24%). At the time of follow-up (mean, 12 +/- 5 months), three patients required elective mitral valve replacement for symptomatic mitral regurgitation and 91% (20 of 22) of the remaining patients had continued improvement in functional class.

To determine whether exposure to chronic hypoxia and subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension induces alterations of endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat pulmonary vascular bed, we studied isolated lung preparations from rats exposed to either room air (controls) or hypoxia (H) during 1 wk (1W-H), 3 wk (3W-H), or 3W-H followed by 48 h recovery to room air (3WH + R). In lungs pretreated with meclofenamate (3 microM), the endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and ionophore A23187 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were examined during conditions of increased tone by U46619 (50 pmol/min). Acetylcholine or A23187 produced dose-dependent vasodilation in control lungs, this response was reduced in group 1W-H (P less than 0.02), abolished in group 3W-H (P less than 0.001), and restored in group 3WH + R. In contrast, the endothelium-independent vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside remained fully active in group 3W-H. The pressor response to 300 pM endothelin was greater in group 3W-H than in controls (6.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) but was not potentiated by the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) antagonists: hydroquinone (10(-4) M); methylene blue (10(-4) M); and pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M) as it was in controls. It was similar to controls in group 3W-H + R.

After a preliminary dose-finding study involving 12 patients with advanced or locally recurrent head and neck cancer, 27 patients were treated on a phase II protocol, using fluorouracil 350 mg/m2/d by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 days, followed on the sixth day by a 2-hour IV infusion of cisplatin 50 mg/m2, administered during the first and fourth weeks of radiation therapy to total doses between 60 and 64 Gy, using 2 Gy daily fractions. Eight of these 27 patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (AJCC) stage III disease, and 12 had stage IV disease. Four had recurrent disease after surgery. Three-year follow-up is now available. Twenty-one (77.8%) remitted completely following treatment, and 11 remain free of local and regional relapse at 3 years. Four have developed systemic metastases. Following successful salvage treatment in two cases, estimated determinate survival at 3 years is 64%. Acute toxicity was manageable with this regime. Eleven instances of grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) mucositis were observed, which caused interruptions to radiotherapy in only four cases. No late sequelae have so far been recorded. It is concluded that the protocol described is tolerable but probably did not cause a greater number of locoregional \"cures\" than would have been expected following conventional radiotherapy alone in this group of patients. The use of infusional fluorouracil with concurrent conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin infusion results in mucositis that limits the dose of fluorouracil to levels that are probably subtherapeutic.

An 8-year study of a single birth cohort In a birth cohort of children in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study in New Zealand, resting blood pressures were recorded biennially five times from age 7 to 15 years. Using previously described methods, we examined the level, trend, and variability of blood pressures in those children with at least three readings. The level, trend, and variability of height, weight, and body mass index were compared among six separate groups of children. Two groups were categorized on the basis of high systolic pressure levels, one with low variability and the other with high variability, which was thought to resemble adult labile hypertension. Two additional groups were categorized on the basis of increasing and decreasing blood pressure trends; the fifth group had consistently low blood pressures, and the sixth group consisted of the remaining children. There were significant differences among the groups for the level of all the physical measurements and for the trend of body mass index.

Nine patients with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation underwent this operation; four patients had chronic atrial fibrillation and five had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the mean duration of symptoms was 12 +/- 8 years. Patient ages ranged from 25 to 68 years (mean 48 +/- 12). At preoperative electrophysiologic study, no patient had evidence of an accessory AV pathway or AV node reentry. Sinus node recovery time could not be determined in five patients because of recurrent atrial fibrillation during or before programmed stimulation. At operation the corridor of atrial tissue connecting the sinus and AV nodes was successfully isolated from the remaining left and right atrial tissue in all patients. One patient required early reoperation for recurrent atrial fibrillation before hospital discharge. At the predischarge electrophysiologic study, the corridor remained isolated in all patients except for one patient who had intermittent conduction between the corridor and excluded right atrium. One patient had nonsustained atrial fibrillation and one had atrial tachycardia evident in the corridor. Atypical AV node reentry of uncertain significance was induced in one other patient. Over a total follow-up of 191 patient months (mean 21 +/- 20), seven patients remained free of atrial fibrillation.

The objectives of the present experiments were to study the effects of long-term low-dose nicotine treatment on skin hemodynamics, viability, and microvascular morphology in 4 x 10 cm dorsally based acute random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. In addition, the reversibility of the nicotine-induced detrimental effects on skin-flap viability following cessation of nicotine treatment also was investigated. Low-dose nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) administered twice daily and subcutaneously for 24 weeks significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased skin-flap capillary blood flow, distal perfusion, and length and area of skin viability compared with the saline-treated control (n = 15). However, these same parameters in rats (n = 15) whose nicotine treatment had been withheld for 2 weeks prior to skin-flap surgery were not significantly different from the control, thus indicating that the detrimental effects of this long-term, low-dose nicotine treatment were reversible. The mean plasma level of nicotine in the nicotine-treated rats was 8.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl and was within the range of plasma nicotine levels reported for human heavy cigarette smokers. Light and electron microscopic studies did not show evidence of histologic damage to the cutaneous microvasculature in acute random-pattern skin flaps and samples of normal (nonoperated) skin in nicotine-treated rats. It is concluded that long-term plasma levels of nicotine similar to those of heavy cigarette smokers are detrimental to the capillary blood flow and viability of random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. These deleterious effects can be avoided if skin flaps are raised 2 weeks after cessation of nicotine treatment. This low-dose nicotine treatment does not cause histologic damage to the microvasculature. Other pathogenic mechanisms of nicotine-induced skin flap ischemia are discussed. ',\n",

In chronic disease situations where treatment comparisons favor no particular therapy, or where definitive outcome requires a considerable follow-up period, it is useful to have additional and perhaps intermediate endpoints of relevant clinical significance to compare treatments. One such endpoint is Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity (TWiST) which, together with Q-TWiST, attempts to address the quality of life of patients receiving the competing regimens. This paper provides a commentary on these techniques with an emphasis on the problems inherent in implementing Q-TWiST, a measure that attempts to incorporate patient value preferences into TWiST. It is argued that while Q-TWiST is intuitively appealing in the clinical setting, there are formidable design and psychometric hurdles that must be overcome to fully operationalize the concept.

The fractional catabolic rate of 68 (19)% of the plasma pool per day was more rapid than other reported human plasma proteins. All radioactivity was excreted in the urine by 14 d. In 16 patients with monoclonal gammopathy or chronic inflammatory diseases, but without amyloidosis, 125I-SAP metabolism was normal. However, among 45 patients with biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis (25, amyloid A type; 20, amyloid L type), 125I-SAP was cleared from the plasma more rapidly, accumulated in the amyloid deposits, and persisted there. The T1/2 in amyloid, measured directly with 131I-SAP, was 24 d. Repeat studies after 6-18 mo were notably consistent in normals but changed significantly in amyloid patients, generally correlating with clinical signs of disease progression. Measurements of 125I-SAP turnover may thus be of value for diagnosis and monitoring of amyloidosis. Analysis of SAP metabolism in amyloidosis suggests that plasma SAP is in dynamic equilibrium with a very large amyloid pool, and in two autopsies the total mass of SAP in the amyloid deposits was 2,100 and 21,000 mg, respectively.

Yet, with this progress there has been a groundswell of protest at the rapidly escalating costs of health care. More than $600 billion was spent on health care in 1989 and estimates of $1.5 trillion are made for the year 2000. Repeated attempts at cost containment have failed. It has been suggested that only by retarding technologic advances will we be able to control costs. Many observers believe that rationing of health care is the only solution, but new technology not only improves cancer care, it often decreases cost. It is not rational to retard advances that may later reduce costs, nor is it humane to retard advances that improve care, even if they cost more. In identifying priorities we should begin with the principle that treatments be restricted to clinical trials unless they have been demonstrated to prolong survival or improve the quality of life. If the payers reimburse procedures in an investigative setting, they will be on firm ground when they deny support for those same procedures outside an investigative setting. This is both an ethical and a fiscally responsible position for the third parties to take. It will not be easy for the profession or for the payers to deal with these problems. Public education and patient education will be key elements of any solution. Shifting the blame from politician to payer to professional will only make the problems worse. ',\n",

Nearly 50% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will initially have nondiagnostic ECGs on ED presentation. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs could be identified using new immunochemical assays for serial CK-MB sampling in the ED. DESIGN: Chest pain patients, more than 30 years old, with pain not caused by trauma or explained by radiographic findings, were eligible for the study. Serial serum samples were drawn on ED presentation (zero hours) and three hours after presentation, then analyzed for CK-MB using four immunochemical methods and electrophoresis. Standard World Health Organization criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of AMI, including new Q-wave formation or elevation of standard in-hospital serum cardiac enzyme markers. SETTING: A tertiary cardiac care community hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The serum from 183 patients hospitalized for possible ischemic chest pain was collected and analyzed. Thirty-one of 183 patients (17%) were found to have AMI by standard in-hospital criteria. Sixteen of the 31 patients (52%) with AMI had nondiagnostic ECGs on presentation. Immunochemical determination of serial CK-MB levels provided a sensitive and specific method for detecting AMI in patients within three hours after ED presentation compared with standard electrophoresis. The four immunochemical methods demonstrated a range in sensitivity from 50% to 62.1% on ED presentation versus 92% to 96.7% three hours later. The immunochemical tests demonstrated specificities ranging from 83.0% to 96.4% at three hours, with three of the four tests having specificities of 92% or greater. Electrophoresis had a sensitivity of 34.5% on ED presentation, increasing to 76.9% at three hours, with a specificity of 98.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Immunochemical CK-MB methods allowed rapid, sensitive detection of AMI in the ED. Early detection of AMI offers many potential advantages to the emergency physician. Early detection of AMI, while the patient is in the ED, could direct disposition of this potentially unstable patient to an intensive care setting. Such information may prevent the ED discharge of patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs. The diagnosis of AMI within a six-hour period after symptom onset may allow thrombolytic therapy to be given to patients with AMI not having diagnostic ECGs. This study served as a pilot trial for a multicenter study of the Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research Group, which is currently ongoing. ',\n",

Five hundred fifty-two cases of primary carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts (gallbladder and periampullary tumors excluded) collected from 55 surgical centers were reviewed retrospectively. Three hundred seven patients (56%) had upper-third lesions (proximal carcinoma), whereas 71 (13%) and 101 (18%), respectively, had middle-third and lower-third bile duct carcinomas. The remaining patients had diffuse lesions. Resectability rates were 32% for upper-third localization compared to 47% and 51% for middle-third and lower-third localization, respectively. The operative mortality rate for proximal carcinomas was significantly lower with resection (16%) compared with palliative surgery (31%) (p less than 0.05). Overall 1-year survival (operative deaths excluded) was 68% after tumor resection compared to 31% after palliative surgery (p less than 0.001). Long-term results after surgical resection correlated with local and regional extension of the disease. The results of this study show that resection of extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas, particularly in an upper-third localization, often is associated with worthwhile long-term survival. ',\n",

To date, the European Carotid Surgery Trial has randomized 2,200 patients, 30% of whom have a carotid stenosis of greater than 70% appropriate to their symptoms. The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial has randomized 1,000 patients, of whom more than half have this severity of appropriate stenosis. Quality control and the evaluation of outcome events in this trial is achieved by a three-tier review, including review by medical and surgical adjudicators who are blinded to the treatment arm of each patient. Baseline characteristics of the patients eligible but not randomized are similar to those of patients who have been randomized. Two percent of the patients randomized to the surgical arm have declined surgery and crossed over to the medical arm, and 3% have elected surgery after randomization to the medical arm.

Orchiopexy with division of the spermatic artery and veins is a commonly used technique for correcting the high undescended testis, although the longterm results have not been clearly defined. The left spermatic artery and veins of 22 adult Wistar albino rats were divided while preserving the vessels associated with the vas and cremaster muscle (DT). A sham operation was performed on the left testicle of six additional rats (ST). At 3 weeks postoperatively, both testes from all rats were removed. All testes were viable and bled when incised, although bleeding was considerably reduced in testes with DT. Mean testicular weights after DT were 1,061 +/- 423 mg compared with 1,634 +/- 125 mg for ST rats (p less than 0.02) and 1,508 +/- 119 mg for contralateral testes. The mean tubular diameter after DT was 220 +/- 37 mu compared with 303.1 +/- 10.7 mu for ST testes (p less than 0.02). The testicular biopsy score based upon the morphology of the spermatic tubules was 4.46 +/- 3.32 for DT testes and 8.65 +/- 0.23 for ST testes (p less than 0.02) compared with 8.38 +/- 0.18 for contralateral testes and an absolute normal value of 10. No morphologic abnormalities were observed in the contralateral unoperated testes from any of the rats. The contralateral testes in 12 additional rats were removed before DT. The mean testosterone values in these rats with one testicle was 1.43 +/- 0.75 ng/mL. Three weeks after DT, testosterone values were 0.19 +/- 0.31 ng/mL (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that division of the main spermatic artery and vein in rats produces testicular atrophy with spermatogenic arrest and interstitial cell dysfunction. Although collateral blood flow to the testis may be demonstrated, tissue perfusion is inadequate for normal spermatogenesis and endocrine function. ',\n",

No neuroanatomic lesions were noted. Aphasia and hyperkinesia were isolated in three patients and associated with global regression of higher cortical functions in one patient. Massive intellectual deterioration and psychotic behavior were associated with transient aphasia in one patient. The epilepsy (focal motor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, subclinical EEG focal seizures during sleep, and atypical absences) always regressed spontaneously or with antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The EEG in waking patients showed focal and generalized spike-wave discharges on a normal background rhythm. Discharge topography and pattern changed frequently. During sleep, discharges always increased. At some time during syndrome development, all patients had bilateral spike-waves for greater than 85% of the sleep period, while at other times the discharges were discontinuous or continuous but focal or unilaterally hemispheric. Discharge topography and abundance changed from night to night. The abnormal EEG and the impaired higher functions developed and regressed together, but not with strict temporal correlation. Our own experience suggests that the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and epilepsy with continuous spike-wave activity in slow-wave sleep cannot be clearly differentiated. They may be different points on the spectrum of a single syndrome. ',\n",
       " 232: 'Cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma can now be made with greater rapidity and accuracy. In the clinical setting of obstructive jaundice, a CT scan or sonogram may suggest cholangiocarcinoma if dilated intrahepatic ducts are seen with a nondilated extrahepatic biliary tree. The diagnosis is confirmed by cholangiography, and the tumor is staged by the combination of cholangiography and angiography. If the tumor extensively involves both lobes of the liver or involves the main portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion is considered unresectable. These patients are best palliated nonoperatively, but they should still have an attempt at a tissue diagnosis, as various other lesions can masquerade as cholangiocarcinoma. In comparison, if the tumor is confined to or is distal to the hepatic duct bifurcation, extends into only one lobe of the liver, or involves only the right or the left portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion may be resectable, and exploration is indicated. As many as half of all patients explored with curative intent will have a successful resection. Various surgical options are appropriate for patients undergoing tumor resection, depending on the site and extent of the lesion. Similarly, several surgical options are possible for palliation in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The role of radiotherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma is uncertain. Our results, like those of many other retrospective analyses, suggest that radiotherapy prolongs survival after curative resection as well as after palliative stenting. However, further data from randomized studies are necessary to support or refute this impression. Further studies of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will also be necessary to improve patient survival. ',\n",

Men were randomly assigned to either a special intervention (SI) program, which consisted of dietary advice for lowering blood cholesterol levels, counseling aimed at cessation for cigarette smokers, and stepped-care treatment for hypertension for those with elevated blood pressure, or to their usual sources of health care within the community (UC). Among the 12,866 randomized men, 8,012 (62%) were hypertensive at baseline. For this subgroup, mortality rates with 10.5 years of follow-up were lower for the SI than for the UC group by 15% (p = 0.19) for CHD and 11% (p = 0.13) for all causes. These results reflected more favorable outcomes for SI compared with UC hypertensive men during the 3.8 posttrial years (March 1982 through December 1985) than during the preceding 6-8 years (through February 1982). During the posttrial years, death rates were lower for SI than for UC men by 26% (p = 0.09) for CHD and 23% (p = 0.02) for all causes. For those with diastolic blood pressure equal to or more than 100 mm Hg, this posttrial trend was a continuation of a trend during the trial; therefore, with 10.5 years of follow-up, death rates were markedly lower for SI than for UC by 36% (p = 0.07) for CHD and 50% (p = 0.0001) for all causes. Similarly, for those without baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities, the favorable posttrial outcome for the SI group was a continuation of a trend during the trial. In contrast, for those with baseline diastolic blood pressure of 90-99 mm Hg and for those with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities, the favorable posttrial mortality findings for the SI group were a reversal of unfavorable trends recorded during the trial. Two factors appear to have contributed to this more favorable mortality trend for the SI group: 1) a change in the diuretic treatment protocol for SI men about 5 years after randomization, which involved replacement of hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone at a daily maximum dose of 50 mg; and 2) a favorable effect of intervention on nonfatal cardiovascular events during the trial years. In addition, delay until the full impact of beneficial effects on mortality end points from smoking cessation and cholesterol lowering could have contributed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). ',\n",

The indications, morbidity, and efficacy of combined reconstruction of the abdominal aorta and visceral arteries (renal and superior mesenteric; excluding suprarenal aortic aneurysms) were analyzed retrospectively in 29 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from June 1984 through February 1990. Seventeen men and 12 women ages 32 to 76 years (mean, 66 years) were studied. Follow-up was complete in all patients to either death or calendar year 1989 to 1990 (mean, 31.9 months; range, 2 to 66 months). All patients underwent bypass of angiographically proven severe lesions of one renal artery (19 patients), both renal arteries (8 patients), or the superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries (2 patients), in concert with synthetic distal aortic replacement for occlusive disease (10 patients) or aneurysm (19 patients). Indications for renal artery repair included severe hypertension in 13 patients, ischemic renal insufficiency in 8 patients, and lesion morphology alone in 8 patients. Operative mortality rate was 3 of 29 (10.3%), and each death was the result of multisystem organ failure. Nonfatal complications occurred in 11 of the 26 survivors (42%), and this group differed significantly from the uncomplicated 15 patients only in having a higher mean preoperative serum creatinine (2.5 +/- 1.1 mg/dl vs 1.6 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, p = 0.04, t test). The mortality rate of patients with preoperative serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl, was 15.4% (2/13 patients), compared to 6.2% (1/16) in patients with creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl. Three late deaths occurred (2 stroke, 1 cancer). Hypertension control improved in 64% of patients overall, and in 7 of 9 patients whose major operative indication was renovascular hypertension. Renal function remained stable or improved in 12 of 15 patients (80%) with renal insufficiency, but 3 patients progressed to require dialysis. Long-term graft patency was demonstrated by angiography or on duplex scan in all studied survivors (21 patients). Although operative risks are clearly increased compared to less complex vascular procedures, careful patient selection and management will yield a favorable outcome in most patients with such combined lesions.

Six months later, while on a regimen of clomiphene citrate, a testicular tumor became palpable. This was sonographically confirmed to be surrounding the calcifications. Testicular calcifications are most commonly associated with benign conditions. We review the literature regarding their relationship to neoplasms and the significance of the ultrasonic findings. Furthermore, this is the sixth reported case of testicular tumor developing during hormonal treatment for oligospermia. Although these cases may be circumstantial, closer surveillance and screening ultrasound may be indicated for subfertile males taking clomiphene citrate. ',\n",

Inhaled pentamidine is used commonly to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. Case reports indicate that PCP can recur in patients who receive inhaled pentamidine and that clinical features may be atypical. To determine the magnitude of this problem, we reviewed retrospectively the medical records of patients with proven PCP during a 30-month period at two hospitals. Four (31 percent) of 13 patients with previous PCP who received inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis had recurrent P carinii infection, including one patient with widely metastatic extrapulmonary disease. Chest roentgenographic findings included cavities, pneumothoraces, bilateral and upper lobe interstitial infiltrates, and pleural effusion. False-negative bronchoalveolar lavage and induced sputum examinations were frequent. We conclude that recurrent PCP in patients maintained on a regimen of inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis occurs frequently, causes chest roentgenographic abnormalities other than interstitial infiltrates, and may be difficult to diagnose. Clinicians who choose to use this effective and convenient mode of prophylaxis should be aware of the problems attendant to its use. ',\n",

Two hundred and seventy-seven patients with advanced carcinoma of the stomach invading the serosa were studied with regard to the relationship between the length of the serosal invasion (LSI) and prognosis, with a division made between expanding and infiltrative types of tumors. Among patients with expanding types of tumors, five year survival rates were 40 per cent in patients with LSI less than 4.0 centimeters, 33 per cent in patients with LSI 4.1 to 6.0 centimeters and 13.0 per cent in patients with LSI more than 6.0 centimeters. Among those patients with infiltrative types of tumors, those with less than 2.0 centimeters of LSI had a better prognosis (five year survival rate of 53 per cent), whereas those patients with a LSI more than 2.0 centimeters had a very poor prognosis (five year survival rate of less than 20 per cent) and the significant LSI on prognosis was found to be 2.0 centimeters.

Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 56 patients with mitral valve prolapse: 15 patients, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 39), died suddenly and mitral valve prolapse was the only cardiac condition found at necropsy (hereafter called isolated mitral valve prolapse); the remaining 41 patients had other conditions that were capable of being fatal. Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated congenital heart disease, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital cardiac abnormalities. Compared with the 34 patients without associated congenital heart disease and with nonmitral valve prolapse conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of mitral regurgitation (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02).

In the anesthetized closed-chest canine model of Gram-negative endotoxemia (n = 10), we tested the hypothesis that the effect of cardiac cycle-specific intrathoracic pressure pulses delivered by a heart rate-(HR) synchronized high-frequency jet ventilator (sync HFJV) on systolic ventricular performance is dependent on the level of preload. To control for HFJV frequency, hemodynamic responses were also measured at fixed frequency within 15% of HR (async HFJV). Biventricular stroke volumes (SV) were measured by electromagnetic flow probes. Measurements were made before (baseline) and 30 min after infusion of 1 mg/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin (serotype 055:B5) and then after 2 mg/kg propranolol at both low (less than 10 mmHg) left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) and high (greater than 10 mmHg) LVFP. Ventricular function curves, aortic pressure-flow (P-Q) relationships, and venous return (VR) curves were analyzed. We found that endotoxin did not alter VR curves but shifted the aortic P-Q curves to the left with pressure on the x-axis (P less than 0.05). Volume loading increased SV (P less than 0.01) because of a rightward shift of the VR curve. No specific differences occurred with either sync or async HFJV during endotoxin, presumably because of preserved VR and shifted aortic P-Q. The lack of cardiac cycle-specific effects of ITP appears to be due to the selective endotoxin-induced changes in peripheral vasomotor tone that counterbalance any depressed myocardial contractility.

In previous studies, we found that biliary scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled iminodiacetic acid ([99mTc]IDA) provided excellent discrimination between intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis, except in patients with profound cholestasis who had poor visualization of the biliary tree. In this study, we have used deconvolution analysis to determine the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) of a hypothetical single circulatory pass of [99mTc]IDA. Our hypothesis was that extraction of radionuclide from the blood would be normal in patients with extrahepatic obstruction alone, but would be impaired in patients with intrahepatic disease (IHD). The purpose of this study was to compare the HEF in patients with profound cholestasis (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl) due to either IHD or common bile duct obstruction (CBDO). Normal subjects (N = 13) had an HEF of 100%. Patients with CBDO (N = 13) had slightly reduced HEF values (92.8 +/- 3.2%) despite profound hyperbilirubinemia (6.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dl). Patients with IHD (N = 23) had a markedly reduced HEF (43.1 +/- 4.1%) which was significantly lower than patients with CBDO and normal subjects (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the determination of the HEF during biliary scintigraphy is helpful in distinguishing between intrahepatic and extrahepatic disease in patients with hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl).

The minority (15%) had virtually absent gastritis and no H. pylori (group 3). Native Indian children were represented in group 1 quite out of proportion to the referral population and had the most severe disease. While it is established that a higher prevalence of asymptomatic H. pylori infection exists in non-Caucasians, this appears to be the first demonstration of a higher prevalence of symptomatic ulcer disease in non-Caucasian children or adults. Caucasian children tended to have primary H. pylori gastritis (group 2) or duodenal ulcer without H. pylori (group 3). Antral nodularity was found to be an important specific endoscopic sign, unique to those children with H. pylori disease. It has not been described in adult H. pylori disease.

The combined use of the counterpulsation devices provided maximal aortic pressure of 111.4 +/- 25.1 mmHg during ventricular fibrillation for a period of 15-60 min. The mean left ventricular pressure was 17.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg, and the cardiac index 64.5 +/- 23.6 ml/kg/min. Cardioversion of ventricular fibrillation to sinus rhythm restored normal hemodynamics. The counterpulsation device implanted on the ascending aorta was not able to maintain circulation for more than 5 min after the induction of ventricular fibrillation, if used alone. In conclusion, the use of two counterpulsation devices implanted on the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery was able to maintain circulation in experimental animals during ventricular fibrillation.

       " 254: 'Human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene regulation by virus and lipopolysaccharide. We have identified a region of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter that is necessary for maximal constitutive, virus-induced, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription. This region contains three sites that match an NF-kappa B binding-site consensus sequence. We show that these three sites specifically bind NF-kappa B in vitro, yet each of these sites can be deleted from the TNF-alpha promoter with little effect on the induction of the gene by virus or LPS. Moreover, when multimers of these three sites are placed upstream from a truncated TNF-alpha promoter, or a heterologous promoter, an increase in the basal level of transcription is observed that is influenced by sequence context and cell type. However, these multimers are not sufficient for virus or LPS induction of either promoter. Thus, unlike other virus- and LPS-inducible promoters that contain NF-kappa B binding sites, these sites from the TNF-alpha promoter are neither required nor sufficient for virus or LPS induction. Comparison of the sequence requirements of virus induction of the human TNF-alpha gene in mouse L929 and P388D1 cells reveals significant differences, indicating that the sequence requirements for virus induction of the gene are cell type-specific. However, the sequences required for virus and LPS induction of the gene in a single cell type, P388D1, overlap. ',\n",

       " 257: 'Actin architecture of cultured human thyroid cancer cells: predictor of differentiation? The actin cytoskeleton is important for cell structure and motility. A disordered actin architecture has been correlated with a high metastatic potential in melanoma, fibrosarcoma, and colon cancer models. Thyrotropin is known to induce growth and differentiation in cultured thyroid cells, whereas the carcinogenic phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) causes dedifferentiation and malignant transformation in many cell lines. We therefore assessed the effect of thyrotropin and TPA on the actin architecture of FTC-133 human follicular thyroid cancer cells in continuous culture. Staining of filamentous actin with rhodamine phalloidin showed that 1 mU/ml or 30 mU/ml thyrotropin-induced actin polymerization was detectable at 1 hour but more notable at 24 hours. Similarly TPA (0.008 to 10 mumol/L) caused rapid actin fiber disruption and redistribution to the cell periphery. Secondary antibody staining for alpha-actinin, a protein that binds and crosslinks actin, was more prominent after treatment with thyrotropin but decreased after TPA. These findings indicate that the actin cytoskeleton has a dynamic response to trophic factors. Thyrotropin promoted actin polymerization, but TPA caused depolymerization. These effects may correlate with cellular alpha-actinin levels. Actin architecture may therefore reflect the state of differentiation of thyroid tumor cells. ',\n",

A study of biliary shock wave lithotripsy of gallstones sponsored by Dornier Medical Systems, Munich, began in the United States in May 1988 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and the need for adjunctive therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). One hundred forty-one symptomatic patients with one to three gallstones 5-30 mm in diameter were randomized to treatment. One week before ESWL, patients were given either UDCA or placebo. This treatment was continued for 6 months. All patients underwent follow-up at predetermined intervals. According to the protocol, re-treatment for fragments larger than 5 mm in diameter could be performed only at 6 weeks; 26 (18%) of the 141 patients were retreated. At 6 months, the stone-free rates for single stones were as follows: patients with noncalcified stones receiving UDCA, 29%; patients with noncalcified stones receiving placebo, 24%; and patients with partially calcified stones receiving either UDCA or placebo, 6%. No significant difference was noted between the UDCA and placebo groups. At 6 months, the stone-free rates in patients with single, noncalcified stones 20 mm or less in diameter were 40% (UDCA) and 32% (placebo), which is superior to rates for those with solitary, noncalcified gallstones 21-30 mm in diameter and those with two or three stones.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of ondansetron with those of high-dose metoclopramide in treating acute and delayed cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. SETTING: Conducted at two university hospitals, a cancer institute, and six community hospitals. PATIENTS: Of 125 patients, 95 were evaluable for the acute phase and 79 for the delayed phase. Major reasons for not being evaluable were no second course (14 patients), protocol violation (5 patients), and change in cisplatin dose (3 patients) for the acute phase, and rescue medication on day 1 (7 patients), protocol violation (3 patients), and inadequate data (4 patients) for the delayed phase. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received cisplatin, 50 to 100 mg/m2 body surface area (median, 75 mg/m2); none had previously received chemotherapy. Thirty minutes before the cisplatin administration, ondansetron was given intravenously over 15 minutes, at a loading dose of 8 mg followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/h for 24 hours. Metoclopramide was given at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg body weight, followed by a continuous infusion for 8 hours (4 mg/kg). For the delayed phase (days 2 through 6), the first oral dose was given as soon as the infusion was completed; the oral dose consisted of either metoclopramide, 20 mg three times daily, or ondansetron, 8 mg three times daily for another 5 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the acute phase, a major or complete response was seen in 72% of the ondansetron-treated and 41% of the metoclopramide-treated patients (P less than 0.001). Nausea was significantly better controlled among the ondansetron-treated patients (P = 0.04). In the delayed phase, no statistically significant difference was seen between ondansetron- and metoclopramide-treated patients. Nausea was significantly better controlled with metoclopramide (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron is significantly more effective than metoclopramide in preventing acute nausea and vomiting. In the delayed phase, the results of both drugs were disappointing, although metoclopramide's effect on delayed nausea was superior. Patients preferred ondansetron. \",\n",
       " 260: 'Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging. Does 24-hour delayed imaging after reinjection enhance detection of viable myocardium? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection immediately after conventional stress-redistribution imaging improves the detection of viable myocardium, as many myocardial regions with apparently \"irreversible\" thallium defects on standard 3-4-hour redistribution images manifest enhanced thallium uptake after reinjection. Because the 10-minute period between reinjection and imaging may be too short, the present study was designed to determine whether 24-hour imaging after thallium reinjection provides additional information regarding myocardial viability beyond that obtained by imaging shortly after reinjection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 50 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease undergoing exercise thallium tomography, radionuclide angiography, and coronary arteriography. Immediately after the 3-4-hour redistribution images were obtained, 1 mCi thallium was injected at rest, and images were reacquired at 10 minutes and 24 hours after reinjection. The stress, redistribution, reinjection, and 24-hour images were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Of the 127 abnormal myocardial regions on the stress images, 55 had persistent defects on redistribution images by qualitative analysis, of which 25 (45%) demonstrated improved thallium uptake after reinjection. At the 24-hour study, 23 of the 25 regions (92%) with previously improved thallium uptake by reinjection showed no further improvement. Similarly, of the 30 regions determined to have irreversible defects after reinjection, 29 (97%) remained irreversible on 24-hour images. These findings were confirmed by the quantitative analysis. The mean normalized thallium activity in regions with enhanced thallium activity after reinjection increased from 57 +/- 13% on redistribution studies to 70 +/- 14% after reinjection but did not change at 24 hours (71 +/- 14%). In regions with irreversible defects that were unaltered by reinjection, mean regional thallium activity did not differ from the reinjection to the 24-hour studies (57 +/- 17% and 58 +/- 17%, respectively). Twenty-four-hour imaging after reinjection showed improvement in only four of 35 irreversible regions (involving three of the 50 patients). CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that thallium reinjection at rest after 3-4 hours of redistribution provides most of the clinically relevant information pertaining to myocardial viability in regions with apparently irreversible thallium defects. Hence, thallium reinjection may be used instead of 24-hour imaging in most patients in whom a persistent thallium defect is observed on conventional redistribution images. ',\n",

Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak. Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40). Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism. Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content. Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal. Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients. Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles. After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea. One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years. We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis. This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea. ',\n",

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1982 to 1990) and bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: In addition to several reviews, studies that evaluated the diagnostic technology of pulmonary embolism were selected. Preference was given to studies with a prospective design, particularly those done within the past decade. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were assessed independently by three unblinded observers. Data were chosen to describe the efficacy of diagnostic technology on the basis of disease prevalence, sensitivity and specificity, and predictive value. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: A normal lung scan or pulmonary angiogram rules out the diagnosis of clinically important pulmonary embolism with at least 95% certainty. Lung scan interpretations indicating high or low probability have approximately a 15% error in diagnosing or ruling out pulmonary embolism. The accuracy of either scan result improves when the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism matches the lung scan result. Serial impedance plethysmography of the lower extremities may exclude thromboembolism with 95% certainty in patients without high-probability lung scan results or cardiopulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of clinical suspicion and the results of the lung scan and impedance plethysmography appear to offer acceptable diagnostic accuracy in evaluating many patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. The usefulness of this approach for patients with cardiopulmonary disease is still unknown. ',\n",

Postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in 186 patients (23%) but did not contribute to any of the six early deaths (30-day mortality rate, 0.8%). Mean (+/- standard deviation) length of hospital stay was longer (9.8 +/- 5.7 versus 8.3 +/- 3.5 days; p less than 0.0001) and mean age was older (65 versus 60 years; p less than 0.002) in patients with postoperative supraventricular tachycardia than in those with regular rhythm. Risk of supraventricular tachycardia was increased in patients with a history of atrial arrhythmias (45% versus 22%; p less than 0.002) or premature atrial contractions on the preoperative electrocardiogram (48% versus 22%; p less than 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age 65 years or more, history of atrial arrhythmia or preoperative premature atrial contractions, and preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more as independent predictors of postoperative supraventricular tachycardia. Six percent of patients converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously; 82% of patients converted within 1.1 +/- 1.9 days after onset of supraventricular tachycardia on treatment with digoxin or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or both. Only 10% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia required electrical cardioversion. We conclude that the risk of supraventricular tachycardia after coronary artery bypass is influenced by patient-related variables and is effectively managed by conventional therapy. Prophylactic treatment should be reserved for elderly patients, especially those who have atrial arrhythmias or have preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more. ',\n",

The admitting conditions of patients in group 2 (HBO) were diabetic, 47%; white blood cell count more than 12,000, 59%; and shock, 29%. Although group 2 patients receiving HBO were more seriously ill on admission, mortality was significantly lower (23%) compared to group 1 (66%) (p less than 0.02). In addition, only 1.2 debridements per group 2 patient were required to achieve wound control versus 3.3 debridements per group 1 patient (p less than 0.03).

Alterations in renal eicosanoid levels have been postulated as a factor in cyclosporin A (CSA) nephrotoxicity. The effects of CSA on renal eicosanoid excretion in rheumatoid arthritis were studied over a 24-week period, during which treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was discontinued. The initial dosage of CSA was 4 mg/kg/day; at week 24, the mean dosage of CSA was 3.9 mg/kg/day. At week 24, the mean (+/- SD) serum creatinine level (1.04 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) was 32% above the baseline value; renal blood flow had decreased by 21% (P less than 0.03) and the glomerular filtration rate had decreased by 16%. There was a significant increase (P less than 0.03) in the 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 level at week 2, but there was no significant change in the levels of the other eicosanoids. This study demonstrates that after CSA treatment, there is a selective increase in a thromboxane metabolite that parallels an increase in renal vascular resistance, even in the absence of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and with unimpaired formation of other vasodilator eicosanoids.

The expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, which are sparse in normal brain, is increased as much as 20-fold in brain tumors. Experimental studies show promise in using labeled ligands to these receptors to identify the outer margins of malignant brain tumors. Whereas positron emission tomography has improved the dynamic understanding of tumors, the labeled selective tumor receptors with positron emitters will enhance the ability to specifically diagnose and greatly aid in the pretreatment planning for tumors. Modulation of these receptors will also affect tumor growth and metabolism. Novel methods to deliver antitumor agents to the brain and new approaches using biologic response modifiers also hold promise to further improve the management of brain tumors. ',\n",

The management of rectovaginal fistulae complicating Crohn's disease is difficult and often unsatisfactory. Between December 1983 and November 1988, 13 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of rectovaginal fistulae via a transvaginal approach. All patients had a diverting intestinal stoma either as part of the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. Each of the patients had low or mid septal fistulae; high fistulae generally are treated transabdominally and are not the focus of this discussion. Fistulae were eradicated in 12 of the 13 women and did not recur during the follow-up period, which averaged 50 months (range, 9 to 68 months). The only treatment failure was a patient who had a markedly diseased colon from the cecum to the rectum and a very low-lying fistula. It is concluded that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulae secondary to Crohn's disease. \",\n",

Out of 40 patients, 21 underwent right-sided and 19 left-sided temporal lobectomy. EEG and CT/MRI were primarily used to select the side of surgery. SPECT results correlated with temporal lobectomy in 68% of the patients. After surgical intervention, memory function was tested for both sides. Following left-sided temporal lobectomy, verbal memory was impaired in 8% of the patients, if SPECT agreed with the side selected for surgery, but in 83%, if it diverged from it. In the present study, there was no relationship between SPECT concordance with the side of temporal lobectomy and outcome as to seizure frequency and non-verbal memory. We conclude that preoperative interictal HMPAO/SPECT can contribute to the prediction of postoperative verbal memory function and that this method should be considered for use prior to temporal lobectomy.

There are basic principles and techniques of measurement that are relevant across biomedical disciplines. The purpose of this article is to explain some of the most important of these for medical rehabilitation, to illustrate how to use them to choose assessment instruments and to describe the nature of measurement in medical rehabilitation by examples in brain injury rehabilitation. Reliability is basic to any scientific measure. Validity, the ultimate criterion, is closely associated with the purpose of the measure. Content validity, criterion validity and construct validity are explained. Sensitivity to rehabilitative interventions and significance in patients' real lives (ecological validity) are emphasized. Measures of functional outcomes (disability) may show improvement after rehabilitation even when impairment measures do not. An extensive but selected list of measures of coma, global status, disabilities, communicative and cognitive impairments, and handicaps is presented, and their main uses are illustrated. Examples illustrate how to choose measures to study comprehensive program-level outcomes, to study learning-based interventions and to develop a general purpose database. Although there are many measures of activities of daily living and mobility, little published evidence of reliability and validity could be found even for some well-known scales. Ecologically valid and sensitive outcome measures are especially needed. Studies of the clinical utility of measures were also scarce. Many of these gaps can be spanned by clinical researchers with limited resources. Physical medicine and rehabilitation will benefit from formal studies of the reliabilities and validities of both its old and its new measurement instruments and by increased sophistication in choice of measures. \",\n",

Rates of restenosis were evaluated in 70 patients (74 lesions) after successful directional coronary atherectomy. The extent of vascular tissue resection was correlated with restenosis rates for coronary (n = 59) and vein bypass graft (n = 15) lesions. After 6 months, the overall restenosis rate was 50% (37 of 74 lesions); it was 42% (15 of 36 lesions) when intima alone was resected, 50% (7 of 14 lesions) when media was resected and 63% (15 of 24 lesions) when adventitia was resected. Subintimal tissue resection increased the restenosis rate for vein grafts (43% with intimal resection versus 100% with subintimal resection, p = 0.01) but not for coronary arteries (50% versus 48%). There was no overall difference in restenosis rates after atherectomy between primary lesions and restenosis lesions that occurred after balloon angioplasty (46% versus 54%). Among postballoon angioplasty restenosis lesions, a higher rate of restenosis after atherectomy was found with subintimal than with intimal resection (78% versus 32%, p = 0.01). Tissues from patients undergoing a second atherectomy for restenosis after initial atherectomy (n = 8) demonstrated neointimal hyperplasia that appeared histologically identical to restenotic tissue developing after balloon angioplasty (n = 37). These data suggest that the cellular response to directional coronary atherectomy is characterized by neointimal proliferation similar to that which may develop after balloon angioplasty. The extent of fibrous hyperplasia appears to be related to the depth of tissue resection in vein graft lesions and coronary artery restenosis lesions that occur after balloon angioplasty but not in primary atheromatous coronary artery lesions.

The success of surgery for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is evaluated by a variety of methods in different hospitals. Unfortunately, the predictive values of these methods are not known. We therefore compared the various methods in 261 patients undergoing surgery for SVT at Westmead Hospital since 1981. Surgical outcome was assessed by early tests during the first week after surgery (serial 12-lead electrocardiograms, telemetric monitoring of the electrocardiogram, and electrophysiological study performed using epicardial wires); later tests at 6 months after surgery (12-lead electrocardiograms and electrophysiological study); and symptomatic review done by telephone interview at a median of 34 months after surgery. Early tests were obtained in 97%, later tests were obtained in 76%, and symptomatic review was obtained in 98% of patients. All of the examined tests were inaccurate methods of surgical assessment compared with the late electrophysiological study. A large proportion of the patients proven to be surgical failures at the late electrophysiological study were not detected by early tests (83%), by later electrocardiograms (66%), or by symptomatic assessment (41%). Accurate assessment of surgical outcome requires a late electrophysiological study to permit comparison of surgical techniques. Late electrophysiological study also provides accurate information on the current risks and benefits of proposed surgery for communication to patients to enable them to make an informed decision on future treatment. Most patients are willing to have a late electrophysiological study and usually benefit from clarification of their true surgical outcome. ',\n",

The beta-cell plasma membranes were derived from a transplantable rat insulinoma generated by subcutaneous injection of RINm5F cells and purified by ultracentrifugation on a 15-55% sucrose gradient. Specific binding of [3H]glipizide to purified beta-cell plasma membranes was determined to be maximal at temperatures of 4-23 degrees C, pH 7.3, and an incubation of 2 h. Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with Kd = 7 nM and sulfonylurea binding of 0.93 pmol/mg membrane protein. Displacement of [3H]glipizide from the purified beta-cell plasma membranes by various sulfonylureas and their analogues correlated well with their known hypoglycemic and insulin-releasing activities. Various agents, including nutrients, agents affecting Ca2+ flux, gastrointestinal hormones, and pancreatic hormones, had no effect on [3H]glipizide binding to the beta-cell plasma membranes. Putative sulfonylurea receptors on beta-cell and brain cell plasma membranes have been reported by several groups of investigators. Sulfonylurea binding to the beta-cell is hypothesized to close an ATP-sensitive K+ channel, which leads to depolarization of the membrane and activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. ',\n",

Technical success was achieved in 17 of 20 laser treated and 18 of 20 intubated patients. Pretreatment swallowing ability, histology, tumour location and overall length were unrelated to functional outcome in both groups. However, circumferential tumour length identified endoscopically strongly influenced the quality of swallowing after laser recanalization. Patients with excellent swallowing quality (n = 7) had significantly shorter circumferential tumour lengths, 3.1(1.0) cm, than those with poorer quality swallowing (n = 10), 6.3(1.6)cm, (P less than 0.001). Both methods of treatment had low complication rates and there was one death in the series in the laser-treated group. Laser recanalization provides a better functional result than intubation for short (less than 4 cm) circumferential tumour.

Intracoronary adenosine (3.75 mg/min; at 1.5 ml/min:total volume = 90 ml; n = 10) or an equivalent volume of saline (1.5 ml/min: total volume = 90 ml; n = 9) was infused into the left main coronary artery during the first 60 minutes of reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow was assessed serially with microspheres and regional ventricular function was assessed by contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was determined histologically. Light and electron microscopy were utilized to assess neutrophil infiltration and microvascular injury. Adenosine failed to reduce infarct size expressed as a percentage of the area at risk (38.0 +/- 4.9% versus 34.8 +/- 4.6%; p = NS) or to improve regional ventricular function as measured by the radial shortening method (3.2 +/- 1.8% versus 2.2 +/- 3.1%; p = NS) at 72 hours after reperfusion. Vasodilatory effects were not observed in the endo- and midmyocardial regions of the ischemic zone during adenosine administration. This was associated with a similar extent of capillary endothelial changes and neutrophil infiltration in both adenosine-treated and saline control groups. These results suggest that severe functional abnormalities are present in the vasculature after 3 hours of ischemia and that adenosine therapy is ineffective in enhancing myocardial salvage. ',\n",

Multivariate logistic analyses examined disability in relation to uncomplicated angina pectoris (AP), complicated AP, and coronary heart disease other than AP, controlling for possible confounders. In younger and older women and men, uncomplicated and complicated AP were associated with disability. Coronary heart disease other than AP was associated with disability only in the younger men.

Their single lesions (43 infarcts and 17 hematomas) were located in the capsulothalamolenticular region, sparing the cortex. Hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow was reduced on the side of the lesion in 25 patients and on both sides in 20. Regional hypoperfusion was observed in 46 patients (ipsilaterally in 34, bilaterally in 10, and contralaterally in two). Regional hypoperfusion was observed most frequently in the frontal lobe, particularly in the motor and premotor cortices of the prerolandic area. The 46 patients with regional hypoperfusion were compared with the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion, considering the size and location of the lesion as well as the functional and analytic motor performances. As a rule, the lesion was slightly smaller and more posterior and the functional (p less than 0.001) and analytic (p less than 0.05) motor performances were significantly better in the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion. Since the xenon-133 inhalation method examines cortical blood flow, we can attribute blood flow reductions resulting from deep-seated lesions to a functional depression akin to diaschisis.

Bipolar electrodes were placed in the right atrium and right ventricle for measurements of heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT), and determination of the incidence and severity of dysrhythmias occurring during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Hearts were divided into three groups: control (n = 20), halothane (n = 12), and isoflurane (n = 13). All hearts were exposed in sequence to oxygenated perfusate (PO2, 530 mmHg), moderately hypoxic perfusate (PO2, 91 mmHg) for 30 min, and then to oxygenated perfusate for 40 min. Halothane (1%, 0.4 mM) or isoflurane (1.5%, 0.5 mM) were administered 10 min before hypoxia, during hypoxia, and during the first 10 min of reoxygenation. Exposure to halothane and isoflurane before hypoxia produced a 14 and 11% decrease in heart rate, a 32 and 23% increase in AVCT, and a 47 and 28% decrease in LVSP (all P less than or equal to 0.001) for halothane and isoflurane, respectively, and no significant change in LVEDP. During hypoxia, HR decreased and AVCT increased similarly in both groups. Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) decreased sharply with a narrowing of the prehypoxic differences among the groups. In the control and isoflurane groups, LVEDP increased during hypoxia but remained unchanged in the halothane group. \",\n",

Lower eyelid retraction associated with prior blepharoplasty, trauma, or other conditions is a challenging problem for the ophthalmic surgeon. We describe a procedure involving tightening the lower eyelid and supraplacing the lateral canthus in combination with in-glove lysis of the lower eyelid retractors and scar tissue. This is accomplished through a small lateral incision. To date, we have treated over 200 eyelids using this technique with excellent results.

Severe thromboembolism occurred in 3 of 37 patients who had undergone Fontan-type operations for correction of congenital heart defects several months to years after the operation. The patients were screened for coagulation factor abnormalities to find out whether known prothrombotic risk factors could explain the high frequency of thromboembolism. 63 abnormalities were found in 24 of the 37 patients. The commonest and most pronounced abnormality was deficiency of protein C, a known risk factor. Concentrations of antithrombin III and factors II and X were significantly lower in protein-C-deficient patients than in those with normal protein C concentrations. These findings suggest that the high thrombotic risk in these patients is caused or at least associated with an imbalance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors. ',\n",

Magnesium concentration was measured in the right atrial appendage of 100 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and associations with serum and mononuclear blood cell magnesium, other laboratory values and patient clinical variables were studied. In addition, magnesium was measured in the right atrial appendage and left ventricular free wall in 23 autopsy subjects to determine whether there was a proportional relation between right atrial appendage and left ventricular free wall magnesium. The mean left ventricular free wall/right atrial appendage magnesium ratio was 2.13 +/- 0.39 (r = 0.67, p = 0.0009). In the group with cardiac surgery, the right atrial appendage magnesium concentration correlated inversely with age (r = -0.54, p = 0.001). The mean right atrial appendage magnesium concentration (micrograms/g wet weight tissue) was lower in patients with postoperative cardiac arrhythmia than in those without arrhythmia (103 +/- 13 versus 111 +/- 10, p = 0.009) and in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients (103 +/- 13 versus 109 +/- 12, p = 0.02). The right atrial appendage magnesium concentration also tended to be lower in patients receiving potassium/magnesium-losing diuretics, although this difference did not achieve statistical significance (105 +/- 14 versus 109 +/- 11, p = 0.16). Right atrial appendage magnesium concentration correlated positively with serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.31, p = 0.002) and negatively with serum calcium concentration (r = -0.29, p = 0.013). Serum magnesium did not correlate with right atrial appendage or mononuclear blood cell magnesium concentration or clinical variables. There was a statistically significant correlation between mononuclear blood cell and right atrial appendage magnesium concentrations in some subgroups of patients. ',\n",

Mitral valve areas before and after balloon mitral valvuloplasty were serially determined by the Doppler continuity equation method in 16 patients. Ultrasound examinations were performed before and immediately after balloon inflation and 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area determined by the Doppler continuity equation method correlated well with that determined at catheterization by the Gorlin formula, not only before but also immediately after balloon inflation (y = 0.87 x + 0.05, standard error of estimate = 0.22 cm2, r = 0.90). Serial calculation of mitral valve area by the Doppler continuity equation method showed a slight but significant decrease in the valve area at 24 hours after balloon mitral valvuloplasty but no change after that. We conclude that the Doppler continuity equation method provides an accurate estimation of mitral valve area before and even after balloon valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area dilated by balloon inflation is decreased slightly within 24 hours after the procedure, which corroborates valve stretch as one mechanism for increasing mitral valve area with balloon valvuloplasty. Estimation of mitral valve area immediately after balloon mitral valvuloplasty may overestimate the long-term efficacy of the procedure. ',\n",

All the patients with STP and two of those with ITN had trigeminal reflex abnormalities; 80% of patients with STP and 30% of those with ITN had evoked potential abnormalities.

The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter. One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported. The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported).

The effect of volume expansion of extracellular fluid on gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of isotonic saline was assessed in three groups of rats using intravenous infusions of isotonic, isotonic-isoncotic, and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions. The gastroduodenal segment of 29 male Wistar rats was barostatically perfused at a constant pressure gradient of 4 cm H2O and changes in flow (ml/minute) were taken as a reflection of changes in gastroduodenal resistance. Isotonic expansion led to a 33% drop in gastroduodenal flow compared with the normovolaemic period in the same animals (p less than 0.01). Extracellular fluid expansion with isotonic-isoncotic and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions was associated with reductions in gastroduodenal flow of 29% (p less than 0.05) and 31% (p less than 0.01) respectively. The increase in gastroduodenal resistance is due to hypervolaemia per se and not to haemodilution, decreases in plasma oncotic pressure, or electrolyte imbalance. The effect of hypervolaemia on gastroduodenal resistance, which was reversed by small haemorrhages (0.5-1.0 ml per 100 g body weight), may be due to changes in tonus or phasic motor activity, or both, and may be part of the homeostatic processes that help the organism minimise liquid volume excess.

       " 321: 'Progress and challenges in psychosocial and behavioral research in cancer in the twentieth century. Research in the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of cancer has shown steady growth since the 1950s, and its course of development has paralleled the history of medical techniques in treating cancer. Table 1 outlines this parallel evolution from the 1850s to the 1960s. The roles of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in spearheading and nurturing research in this area are documented. Interest in psychooncologic questions can be traced back for centuries to the search for etiologic factors and psychologic variables that would explain individual vulnerability to cancer. The first psychologic studies of cancer patients were reported in 1951 and 1952 from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, respectively. The 1970s saw new interest in psychosocial and behavioral research with many issues being addressed for the first time: better care of the terminally ill through more humanistic approaches including better means of pain control; ethical concerns related to patient rights and their status as subjects in experimental protocols; trying to measure quality of life for cancer patients on protocols; seeing the need for multidisciplinary collaborative groups to make up for the absence of formal training in this area; and the need to design valid, accurate measuring scales specific to the symptomology of patients with cancer. Table 4 outlines how the 1980s gave increasing recognition and support to the psychosocial dimensions of cancer. This period produced a series of key conferences that examined a broad research and education perspective and produced recommendations that remain a benchmark in regard to instrumentation, conceptual models, pitfalls of psychosocial research, training, and education, and the organization of research efforts. New precision has been added to the field in the past 6 years: studies measuring concurrent psychologic, endocrine, and immune function; use of statistical modeling to incorporate quality of life data as a correction factor in survival data (TWiST and QALY); and broadened definitions of medical outcome to include functional status, thus allowing advances in psychiatric measurements to help answer questions in cancer. The challenges for the 1990s are identified in a summary in Table 9. Especially noteworthy is the observation that the comprehensive research needed today cannot be carried out by any one discipline alone. New approaches call for areas of the social sciences formerly inactive in cancer research (e.g., anthropology) to contribute the tools and expertise required to address the problems. ',\n",

Despite difficulty in long-term maintenance of spinalized rabbits, muscular pathologic changes in chronic spinalized rabbits could be observed for a period of four weeks. Rabbits were prepared by spinal cord transection at T10 (spastic paralysis) or by spinal cord removal below L7 (flaccid paralysis). Spastic preparations showed hind-limb spasticity and reflex incontinence one to two days after operation. Hypertrophic fibers began to appear in spastic muscles after two weeks. This hypertrophy, thought to be caused by phasic repetitive contraction, was verified by electron microscopy to be different from normal exercise hypertrophy. Flaccid preparations maintained hind-limb flaccidity and overflow incontinence. In flaccid muscle, marked muscle fiber necrosis indicated rapid atrophy.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical usefulness of renography performed in combination with captopril administration (\"captopril renography\") in diagnosing renal artery stenosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with suspected renal artery stenosis underwent renography prior to performance of renal angiography. Renography was performed on two consecutive days using technetium-99m-diethylenetiamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) as an index of glomerular filtration rate and iodine-131-orthoiodohippurate (OIH) as an index of renal blood flow. Captopril (25 mg orally, crushed) was administered 1 hour before the second study. Renal artery stenosis was defined as a stenosis exceeding 70%. Renographic criteria were then established, retrospectively, to differentiate renal artery stenosis from essential hypertension based on (1) asymmetry of function and (2) the presence of captopril-induced changes. RESULTS: Renal artery stenosis was detected in 35 of 55 patients (21 with unilateral and 14 with bilateral stenosis). Three criteria were established for diagnosing renal artery stenosis: (1) a percent uptake of DTPA by the affected kidney of less than 40% of the combined bilateral uptake, (2) a delayed time to peak uptake of DTPA, which was more than 5 minutes longer in the affected kidney than in the contralateral kidney, (3) a delayed excretion of DTPA, with retention at 15 minutes, as a fraction of peak activity, more than 20% greater than in the contralateral kidney. The presence of one or more of these criteria was diagnostic of renal artery stenosis, with a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 75%, respectively before captopril administration, and 94% and 95% after captopril administration. Lesser degrees of asymmetry (i.e., uptake of 40% to 50%) had very poor diagnostic specificity. Among patients with bilateral stenoses, asymmetry identified the more severely affected kidney, but the presence or absence of stenosis in the contralateral kidney could not be reliably determined. When pre- and post-captopril studies were compared, the presence of captopril-induced scintigraphic changes was a highly specific finding for renal artery stenosis, but occurred in only 51% of the cases. OIH scintigraphy provided similar results, with slightly lower sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Asymmetry of DTPA uptake, time to peak uptake, or retention seen on a single post-captopril renogram is a highly sensitive and specific finding in detecting renal artery stenosis but does not distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease. If renograms are obtained both before and after captopril administration, the presence of captopril-induced change is a highly specific finding for the detection of renal artery stenosis, but the sensitivity of this finding is low.

Twenty male infants less than 1 year of age with acute diarrhea and dehydration were randomly assigned to a study group and studied in blind fashion in a metabolic unit to assess the efficacy of the addition of 30 mmol/L alanine to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) oral rehydration solution (ORS). Patients were exclusively rehydrated with one of two types of ORS during the first 24 hours of treatment. On the second day, oral feedings were started with a lactose-free formula, and ORS was given to replace stool losses. Body weight, ORS, food intake, vomitus, stool, and urine output were recorded at 6-hour intervals. Blood was drawn at the time of admission, after rehydration, and at 24 and 48 hours of hospitalization to monitor blood gases and electrolytes. Rehydration was satisfactory in both groups of patients. ORS that contained alanine did not reduce the purging rates of the infants compared with those who received standard ORS. Clinically no adverse effect of the alanine-based ORS was observed during hospitalization. None of the patients had significant hypernatremia or hyponatremia, and serum amino acid levels were not altered. These data show that the addition of 30 mmol/L alanine to the standard WHO-ORS produces no further improvement in the outcome of the infants with acute diarrhea compared with those fed the standard WHO-ORS.

Coronary thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for patients with acute Q-wave myocardial infarcts who have no contraindications to such therapy. However, the time required for thrombolysis and the possibility of reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. Herein are described experimental animal studies and clinical evaluations in which attempts have been made to develop adjunctive therapies that, when coupled with available thrombolytic interventions, might shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent reocclusion. From the studies conducted to date, it is clear that a combined thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonist with a serotonin receptor antagonist and heparin shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models with copper coil-induced coronary artery thrombi. A monoclonal antibody to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor coupled with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and heparin also shortens the time to thrombolysis and delays or prevents reocclusion in experimental canine models. Thrombin inhibitors, including heparin and synthetic inhibitors, given with t-PA and aspirin, appear to shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models. Aspirin coupled with intravenous streptokinase reduces mortality in patients with presumed acute myocardial infarction, and a combination of heparin and t-PA results in infarct-artery patency more frequently than t-PA without heparin. Data from these studies are encouraging with regard to the possibility of developing effective and relatively safe thrombolytic regimens that shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion.

A total of 1,975 plasma diltiazem concentrations were obtained from 1,067 patients enrolled in a multicenter secondary intervention study of diltiazem after acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the determinants and significance of diltiazem concentrations in this patient population, we related drug concentrations to a variety of clinical variables recorded on the case history forms. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that (1) time from the last drug dose, (2) drug dose taken, (3) patient height (an index of lean body weight), and (4) patient age were important determinants of plasma concentration. For an equivalent dose, plasma diltiazem concentrations in a 75-year-old patient were about double those of a 25-year-old patient. Total weight and drug dose prescribed did not significantly affect plasma concentrations. Whereas drug concentrations were higher (p = 0.01) among patients with left-sided heart failure, they were not altered by renal dysfunction, hepatic disease or beta blockers. Diltiazem concentrations were a significant determinant of diastolic arterial pressure (p less than 10(-9), but neither systolic pressure nor heart rate were significantly related to diltiazem concentration. The overall incidence of adverse experiences was not related to drug concentrations, but the occurrence of second- and third-degree atrioventricular block in the coronary care unit and the need for a temporary pacemaker were substantially higher among patients with a drug concentration greater than 150 ng/ml (7.4 and 1.9%, respectively) than among patients with lower concentrations (2.6% for atrioventricular block, 0.3% for pacemaker; p = 0.02 for each). The risk of atrioventricular block was particularly increased by high diltiazem concentrations in the face of acute inferior infarction. These results suggest that diltiazem's pharmacologic and clinical effects in a large population are concentration-related, and that the consideration of patient size, age, and left ventricular function in selecting a diltiazem dose may allow for effective drug therapy with a reduced likelihood of adverse effects. \",\n",

We investigated the role of prostanoid-mediated pressor mechanisms in setting the level of blood pressure in renin-dependent and renin-independent models of hypertension in unanesthetized rats. Intravenous administration of a blocker of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors, SQ29548 (2 mg/kg bolus injection plus 2 mg/kg/hr for 3 hours), reduced from 162 +/- 4 to 144 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) the blood pressure of rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 7-14 days after coarctation when plasma renin activity is greatly increased. In contrast, treatment with SQ29548 was without effect on the blood pressure of either normotensive or hypertensive rats (i.e., aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 90-113 days after coarctation, deoxycorticosterone-salt-induced hypertension) having normal or depressed values of plasma renin activity. The blood pressure-lowering effect of SQ29548 in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension was positively correlated with the prevailing plasma renin activity and could not be demonstrated in hypertensive rats pretreated with indomethacin. We attribute the hypotensive effect of SQ29548 to interference with pressor mechanisms that depend on activation of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors and suggest that such prostanoid-mediated mechanisms are operational and contribute to an increase in blood pressure in angiotensin-dependent forms of hypertension. Also prostanoid-mediated vasodepressor mechanisms are operational in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension since the blood pressure of rats pretreated with SQ29548 was increased by the subsequent administration of indomethacin. Accordingly, the blood pressure of rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension is influenced by the interplay of prostanoid-mediated pressor and vasodepressor mechanisms. ',\n",

We studied 39 consecutive patients (37 men and two women, mean age 57.3 years) referred to our institute for elective coronary artery bypass. Five patients had single, 12 patients double, 20 patients triple vessel disease, and two had left main stem disease. Nineteen left internal mammary artery grafts, 20 sequential grafts, and 39 single vein grafts were performed. All the patients were subjected to the test before (time range 1 to 3 days) and after (time range 6 to 10 days) the operation in the absence of therapy. Dipyridamole was administered intravenously 0.56 mg/kg over 4 minutes (low dose); if no effect was apparent, an additional 0.28 mg/kg over 2 minutes (high dose) was given. During the test, blood pressure and a twelve-lead electrocardiogram were monitored. An arbitrary wall motion score was derived by dividing the left ventricle into six regions and grading from 0 to 3-normokinetic, hypokinetic, akinetic, and dyskinetic zones. Preoperatively the test was positive in 38 patients as evidenced by wall motion abnormalities (36 patients had electrocardiographic changes) and in one patient by electrocardiographic changes and chest pain; 22 tests were positive after the low dose and 17 after the high dose. Angina was present in 33 patients. Mean wall motion score was 1.64 per patient in the basal condition and 4.03 per patient after the test (p less than 0.001). After coronary bypass in three patients the test was positive at the same dosage that was used preoperatively, as shown by wall motion abnormalities (in two patients by electrocardiographic changes, as well). Four patients had symptoms. Furthermore, at 6 months' follow-up, a treadmill stress test performed in these three patients was positive for ischemia and angina. The wall motion score was 1.25 per patient in the basal condition and 1.53 per patient after the test (no significant difference). When the preoperative wall motion score obtained after dipyridamole echocardiography was compared with the postoperative score, a statistically significant difference was seen: 4.03 per patient versus 1.53 per patient (p less than 001). In eight patients we observed an improvement of basal myocardial contractility after the operation, which indicates the reversibility of wall motion abnormalities observed before coronary bypass. In conclusion our data show that the dipyridamole-echocardiography test is a suitable method for the early assessment of bypass grafting when other methods, exercise dependent, are not indicated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). \",\n",

To assess the magnitude of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) occurrence among recipients of pituitary-derived human growth hormone (HGH), we conducted an epidemiologic follow-up of 6284 recipients of HGH distributed through the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Seven neuropathologically confirmed cases of CJD have occurred in this population to date: six patients with clinical CJD presented with ataxia and imbalance, rather than with altered mentation, which is the most common initial manifestation in sporadic CJD, and one patient died in the preclinical incubation state of the disease. All seven cases occurred among the nearly 700 HGH recipients who started therapy before 1970. Since only 10% of the cohort has been followed up for the 15-year average incubation interval from midpoint of HGH treatment to onset of symptoms, the great majority of potentially exposed patients have not yet attained the requisite incubation period for expression of CJD. The median duration of HGH therapy of 100 months in the CJD cases was significantly longer than 41 months for all patients starting treatment before 1970; thus, the duration of pituitary HGH therapy is a major risk factor for CJD.

The maintenance of cellular levels of high-energy phosphates is required for myocardial function and preservation. In animals, severe myocardial ischemia is characterized by the rapid loss of phosphocreatine and a decrease in the ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP. METHODS. To determine whether ischemic metabolic changes are detectable in humans, we recorded spatially localized phosphorus-31 nuclear-magnetic-resonance (31P NMR) spectra from the anterior myocardium before, during, and after isometric hand-grip exercise. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SD) ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP in the left ventricular wall when subjects were at rest was 1.72 +/- 0.15 in normal subjects (n = 11) and 1.59 +/- 0.31 in patients with nonischemic heart disease (n = 9), and the ratio did not change during hand-grip exercise in either group. However, in patients with coronary heart disease and ischemia due to severe stenosis (greater than or equal to 70 percent) of the left anterior descending or left main coronary arteries (n = 16), the ratio decreased from 1.45 +/- 0.31 at rest to 0.91 +/- 0.24 during exercise (P less than 0.001) and recovered to 1.27 +/- 0.38 two minutes after exercise. Only three patients with coronary heart disease had clinical symptoms of ischemia during exercise. Repeat exercise testing in five patients after revascularization yielded values of 1.60 +/- 0.20 at rest and 1.62 +/- 0.18 during exercise (P not significant), as compared with 1.51 +/- 0.19 at rest and 1.02 +/- 0.26 during exercise before revascularization (P less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. The decrease in the ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP during hand-grip exercise in patients with myocardial ischemia reflects a transient imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in myocardium with compromised blood flow. Exercise testing with 31P NMR is a useful method of assessing the effect of ischemia on myocardial metabolism of high-energy phosphates and of monitoring the response to treatment. ',\n",
       " 336: 'Detection of circulating candida enolase by immunoassay in patients with cancer and invasive candidiasis BACKGROUND. Invasive candidiasis is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. Few biochemically defined markers of invasive candidiasis are known. Initial findings suggested that the presence of candida enolase in the blood may be a novel marker for invasive candidiasis. METHODS. We tested 170 patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis for candida enolase antigenemia. All the patients had cancer and neutropenia. We detected antigen using a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay for candida enolase in serially collected serum samples. Invasive candidiasis was proved by finding candida species in deep nonmucosal tissue, blood cultures, or both. Antigen testing was performed with the investigator blinded to tissue or culture diagnosis. RESULTS. Among 24 patients with proved invasive candidiasis, 149 serum samples were tested for enolase antigenemia; 80 were positive and 69 negative (sensitivity per sample, 54 percent). Multiple sampling improved the detection of antigenemia, which was found in 11 of 13 proved cases of deep tissue infection (85 percent) and in 7 of 11 proved cases of fungemia (64 percent). Specificity was 96 percent as measured against control groups including patients with mucosal colonization, bacteremia, and other deep mycoses. Antigenemia was detected in the absence of fungemia in 5 cases of deep tissue candidiasis, but was not detected in 6 cases of fungemia alone. CONCLUSIONS. Candida enolase antigenemia is a novel marker for invasive candidiasis. It may be a useful indicator of deep infection in patients with cancer and neutropenia and may complement the diagnostic usefulness of blood cultures. ',\n",
       " 337: 'Clonotypic analysis of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies from experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis-sensitive Lewis rats and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis-resistant Wistar Furth rats. A single immunization of Lewis rats with purified acetylcholine receptor (AChR) emulsified in adjuvant typically stimulates the production of oligoclonal AChR-reactive antibodies (as demonstrated by IEF) dominated by the IgG2a subclass, of moderate but clonotypically heterogeneous relative Ag-binding avidity, and capable of inducing symptoms of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Although similar immunization of Wistar Furth rats produces AChR-reactive antibodies with similar characteristics of clonotypic heterogeneity, avidity, and isotype expression, no detectable signs of AChR-dependent muscle impairment is observed. This contrasts the ability to induce impaired AChR function upon the passive transfer of pre-formed Lewis anti-AChR antibodies into naive Wistar Furth rats, suggesting that disease resistance in this model is not conferred at the level of the AChR itself. Moreover, if more aggressive immunization protocols are used (i.e., multiple injections of AChR), a transient breakthrough of AChR-dependent muscle dysfunction can be induced directly in the Wistar Furth strain indicating that the potential for the production of disease-causing antibodies does exist in the Wistar Furth repertoire. IEF analysis of Wistar Furth anti-AChR antibodies has revealed that hyperimmunization results in modified antibody clonotype expression that might explain changing expression of disease symptoms; however, explanations for the apparent \"resistance\" of Wistar Furth rats to disease induction are likely to be complex.

The resting electrocardiographic (ECG) sinus heart rate was low for age in only 1 of 13 patients, while the lowest Holter-monitored sinus heart rate was abnormal in 4 of 12. The maximum exercise heart rate was abnormally low in 6 of the 12 who underwent exercise testing. For the EPS tests, the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) was long in 8 of 14 and the sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) was long in six of the nine in whom it was calculable. When both noninvasive and EPS indices are considered, 13 of the 14 patients had some type of sinus node dysfunction. ',\n",

We examined the effects of the following variables on interpleural analgesia after thoracotomy: addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic, thoracostomy drainage, two-catheter placement, and location of catheter tips. Twenty patients were randomized to have one catheter (paravertebral tip location) or two catheters (paravertebral and lateral thoracic wall tip locations). Interpleural catheters were sutured to the parietal pleura by the surgeon at time of wound closure. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine through the single catheter or 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with or without 1:200,000 epinephrine through each of the two catheters while supine. Bupivacaine concentrations in whole blood and in thoracostomy drainage fluid were assayed by gas chromatography. Actual content of bupivacaine in the drainage fluid was calculated. Degree of analgesia was assessed by verbal numerical pain scores over the first 4 h and opioid demand thereafter. Addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine did not influence the degree of analgesia. Approximately 30%-40% of any administered dose of bupivacaine was lost via the thoracostomy tube over a 4-h period. There was no correlation between the true initial dose (100 mg minus thoracostomy drainage) and Cmax. Use of two catheters resulted in significantly less opioid requirements after an initial 8-h period. Failure to achieve adequate interpleural analgesia in postthoracotomy patients may be related to loss of anesthetic via thoracostomy drainage, presence of extravasated blood and tissue fluid in the pleural space, and possibly sequestration and channeling of flow of local anesthetic by restricted motion of an operated lung.

Fourteen cases originating in the nose and paranasal sinuses, mandible, temporal bone, and larynx were reviewed. Aggressive surgical resection was the mainstay of treatment, and resulted in an overall survival of 70%, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years. Survival was highest in primary temporal bone lesions, and lowest in paranasal sinus lesions. Unresectable lesions were not cured by other modalities. This study, therefore, continued to support the crucial role of wide surgical resection in the treatment of head and neck chondrosarcoma, but conservative resection, when needed to preserve important structures, has resulted in long-term survival. \",\n",
       " 342: 'Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Relation to Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis and gastric acid secretion. Since Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa in most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer, infection with this organism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this common disease. We postulated that if H. pylori is pathogenic in the usual type of duodenal ulcer, it should be less common when duodenal ulcer has another, specific etiology, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastric mucosa was compared from 18 patients with proven Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (17 of whom had had duodenal ulcer disease) and 18 controls with chronic duodenal ulcer without such a diagnosis. All subjects, who were matched for age and sex, had undergone elective gastric resections. Gastric tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were reviewed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. The frequency of H. pylori in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (8/18) was lower than in controls with duodenal ulcer (16/18; P less than 0.02). Moreover, chronic antral gastritis scores were higher in patients with duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.01). In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peak acid output was lower in patients positive (median 22 meq/30 min) compared to those negative for H. pylori (median 32 meq/30 min; P less than 0.02) but serum gastrin was correspondingly lower in patients positive for H. pylori (P less than 0.05). H. pylori infection appears to be more frequent when duodenal ulceration is not associated with another etiology, such as acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may also be associated with decreased gastric acid secretion. ',\n",

We have isolated a 1.1-kilobase cDNA clone that encodes human fibrillarin by screening a hepatoma library in parallel with DNA probes derived from the fibrillarin genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NOP1) and Xenopus laevis. RNA blot analysis indicates that the corresponding mRNA is approximately 1300 nucleotides in length. Human fibrillarin expressed in vitro migrates on SDS gels as a 36-kDa protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by antisera from humans with scleroderma autoimmune disease. Human fibrillarin contains an amino-terminal repetitive domain approximately 75-80 amino acids in length that is rich in glycine and arginine residues and is similar to amino-terminal domains in the yeast and Xenopus fibrillarins. The occurrence of a putative RNA-binding domain and an RNP consensus sequence within the protein is consistent with the association of fibrillarin with small nucleolar RNAs. Protein sequence alignments show that 67% of amino acids from human fibrillarin are identical to those in yeast fibrillarin and that 81% are identical to those in Xenopus fibrillarin. This identity suggests the evolutionary conservation of an important function early in the pathway for ribosome biosynthesis. ',\n",

Intraoperative evaluations were compared with histologic findings. In 85 cases not diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, malignancy was confirmed in 97.6 percent of cases and histologic type in 71.8 percent. In the 28 cases diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, there was only one false-negative. The most important finding during thoracotomy is whether a lesion is malignant or not. The time required to obtain a pathologic diagnosis also is important. We are able to obtain the results of a cytologic diagnosis within 10 min.

The diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. The 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). All patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. Only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. At the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. On the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. Multivariate analysis (by Cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. The identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer. ',\n",

Gated pool scintigraphy confirmed normal LV systolic function but demonstrated severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Catheterization revealed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as the cause of right-sided failure.

Functional limitations included depending on others for transportation (33%) and mental incompetence or poor recent memory (42%). The percentage of patients with functional limitation increased sharply with increasing age. In a substantial number of patients there was also evidence for poor social support networks; 26.5% of subjects lived alone and 38.9% had no children living in the vicinity. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the predictors of having a poor social support network included non-Hispanic white ethnicity, advanced age, low income, and being a recent migrant to the area. Subjects with functional limitations were more likely to have poor social support networks than subjects without such limitations. The deleterious combination of impaired functional status and a limited social support network may explain why elderly cancer patients are at increased risk for not receiving appropriate therapy. Given the potential complexities involving the evaluation and appropriate treatment of cancer, care must be taken to adequately assess functional status and support mechanisms of older patients, and to provide adequate support to ensure compliance with treatment.

Supramaximal single- and multiple-pulse stimulation of the common peroneal nerve produced stable torque responses of the dorsiflexor muscles (monitored in vivo), which dantrolene suppressed. With the multiple-pulse stimulation (5-6 pulses) this torque suppression was significantly less in MH-susceptible subjects than in control subjects. This distinction, also observed in MH swine, confirms this animal as a good model for human MH. That dantrolene's effect in MH can be more completely reversed with high frequency stimulation is intriguing; presumably, excitation-contraction coupling differs in MH and normal muscle. \",\n",

This study 1) compares the negative chronotropic and dromotropic actions of adenosine in guinea pig, rat, and rabbit hearts; 2) investigates the mechanism(s) for the different responses; and 3) determines the physiological implications. Isolated perfused hearts were instrumented for measurement of atrial rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time. Differences in metabolism of adenosine were determined in the absence and presence of dipyridamole (nucleoside uptake blocker) and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, adenosine deaminase inhibitor). Dipyridamole plus EHNA decreased adenosine's EC50 for the negative dromotropic effect by 14-fold in guinea pig heart and 1.6-fold in rat heart. This is consistent with the greater number of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding sites measured in membranes from guinea pig (1,231 +/- 68 fmol/mg protein) compared with rat (302 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein) and rabbit (260 +/- 28 fmol/mg protein) atria. The potency of adenosine to slow atrial rate and prolong AV nodal conduction time was greater in guinea pig than in rat or rabbit hearts. This rank order of potency correlated well with the number of binding sites for the specific adenosine receptor radioligand 125I-aminobenzyladenosine in guinea pig (102 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein), rat (11 +/- 0.5 fmol/mg protein), and rabbit (8 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein) atrial membranes. Hypoxia increased the rate of adenosine release by severalfold and caused slowing of heart rate and AV block. In spontaneously beating hearts, the main effect of hypoxia was a slowing of ventricular rate, which in the guinea pig heart was due to AV block and in the rat heart to atrial slowing. In atrial paced hearts, hypoxia caused a marked prolongation of AV nodal conduction time in guinea pig (39 +/- 4 msec) and rabbit (29 +/- 5 msec) hearts, but only small effect in rat hearts (10 +/- 2 msec). The differences in response to hypoxia could be accounted for by the species-dependent differences in the 1) amount of adenosine released and metabolized, 2) sensitivity of the hearts to adenosine, and 3) dependency of AV nodal conduction on atrial rate. The findings indicate that the results from physiological or pharmacological studies on adenosine in one species may not be applicable to others, and the ultimate effect of adenosine and hypoxia is to slow ventricular rate. \",\n",

The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration.

An Incidence of co-morbid cardiac disease in the elderly surgical patient as high as 66% has been previously reported. Even in the absence of clinically significant cardiac disease, advanced age alone is often considered sufficient indication for Swan-Ganz placement, hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid states, and inotropic support. Yet data clearly documenting the need for this evaluation and therapy are difficult to obtain. All major general surgical and orthopedic operations in non-agenarians were reviewed in our institution from July 1, 1987 through December 31, 1988. Fifty-one procedures were performed on 46 patients. None of these patients had preoperative Swan-Ganz catheterization or hemodynamic evaluation. Eighteen general surgical, 30 orthopedic, 2 neurosurgical, and 1 gynecological procedures were performed. Forty-three were performed under general anesthesia, 7 under spinal anesthesia, and 1 with local anesthesia. Seven out of 51 patients (14%) experienced major complications, and 16 out of 51 (31%) experienced minor complications. Thirty-day mortality was 0%, and 6-month survival was 92%. Only one complication occurred within 48 hours of surgery that might possibly have been prevented with hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid status, inotropic support, and intensive care unit monitoring.

Thirty-six high-risk patients at the University of South Florida-affiliated hospitals received small-diameter shunts because of bleeding esophagogastric varices over a recent 2-year period. Portal vein and portal vein-inferior vena cava gradients were significantly reduced after shunting. These pressure changes were manifested clinically by the absence of variceal rebleeding and improvement of ascites; in addition, the incidence of encephalopathy was low. The 8-mm graft maintained hepatopedal flow in 67% of the patients, but reversal of flow did not result in complications commonly associated with poor portal perfusion. Graft thrombosis occurred in four (11%) patients. All grafts were successfully revised, three by operative revision and one by an interventional radiologist. Operative mortality was low (11%), and morbidity was unusual. The small-diameter H-graft portacaval shunt is a safe and effective method of treatment for bleeding esophagogastric varices. ',\n",

Three unusual cases of oropharyngeal lympho-proliferative lesions were seen in recipients of heart and heart-lung transplants. Two caused acute upper respiratory obstruction necessitating urgent ENT intervention. All patients were receiving immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporin. The two obstructive cases were adenotonsillar enlargement in a 6-year-old, and a tumour of the tonsil and tongue base with cervical lymph node enlargement in a 32-year-old male. Both were caused by Epstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. The third patient, a 32-year-old female, had a presumed low grade T-cell lymphoma that regressed spontaneously. Histopathological diagnosis of these lympho-proliferative disorders after transplantation usually requires immunocytochemistry to distinguish polyclonal proliferative disorders from true lymphoma. Polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorders after transplantation do not usually require aggressive cytoreductive therapy, but respond to simple measures such as the reduction of immunosuppression.

Conventional angiography, two-dimensional inflow magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, and color duplex ultrasound (US) were performed on 12 patients in a blinded, prospective study. The ability to grade arterial lesions and plan revascularization interventions were compared. Arterial lesions were categorized as nonsignificant (0%-49% diameter reduction) or significant (50%-100% diameter reduction). Determination of nonsignificant and significant lesions with MR angiography was in agreement with that at conventional angiography in 100 of 140 lesions (71%). Agreement between results of conventional angiography and color duplex US occurred with 114 of 123 infrainguinal lesions (93%). Twenty-one vascular interventions were planned by using conventional angiography; there was agreement with color duplex US in 11 cases and MR angiography in five. Color duplex US performed well in the assessment of infrainguinal disease but was limited in the evaluation of iliac segments because of nonvisualization. The iliac region was visualized in more patients with MR angiography than with color duplex US, but image quality with MR angiography was inconsistent. Strategies to improve MR angiography of the peripheral vasculature merit further study. ',\n",

Two hundred and ninety-eight critically ill patients at risk for the development of postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding were randomized into three groups. The first group comprised 85 patients who received meciadanol, a new bioflavonoid, 500 milligrams every six hours through a nasograstric tube; the second group comprised 100 patients who received sucralfate (crushed tablets), 1,000 milligrams every six hours through a nasogastric tube, and the third group comprised 113 patients who received an antacid (Maalox [magnesium aluminum hydroxide gel]) through a nasogastric tube at an initial dose of 15 milliliters every hour. The gastric pH was measured hourly and titrated to a pH greater than or equal to 4.0 in patients in the group receiving the antacid. The gastric pH was measured every two hours in the other two groups. Bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract was determined visually (frank blood in gastric contents) or by guaiac testing. Bleeding occurred in seven patients receiving meciadanol, nine receiving sucralfate and six receiving the antacid. The difference in rates of bleeding was not statistically significant. Correlation between the severity of illness index and the development of bleeding was poor, at least in the low and intermediate index range. In contrast, there was a strong correlation between the age of the patient and the development of bleeding. Only one patient younger than 50 years had bleeding develop. Apparently, meciadanol exerts its action by a mechanism other than pH control. It may, therefore, fill an important gap in the ability to prevent postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding. ',\n",

To estimate the incidence of residual atrial septal perforation (ASP) following percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) with the Inoue balloon catheter and to examine the factors contributing to ASP, we studied 46 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing PTMC. Residual ASP was evaluated by Doppler color flow imaging 1 day after PTMC, and was detected in 7 out of 46 patients (15.2%). We examined the relationship between the development of ASP (ASP+) and the age of the patient, the left atrial dimension before PTMC, the mean pressure difference between left and right atrium after PTMC, and the duration of the procedure from atrial septal puncture by the Brockenbrough method to balloon inflation. There was a good correlation between the development of residual ASP and the duration of the procedure (ASP+, 51.0 +/- 34.0 minutes; without ASP, 24.6 +/- 16.2 minutes; p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant correlation between the development of ASP and other factors. In the follow-up study, ASP disappeared in four patients within 3 months. ASP persisted in two patients for 1 year after PTMC. However, the shunt in these two patients was clinically insignificant. These data suggest that residual ASP may depend on the duration of the procedure, and that most cases of ASP disappear within 1 year after PTMC. ',\n",

Like childhood rheumatic fever, psychic trauma sets a number of different problems into motion, any of which may lead to a definable mental condition. The author suggests four characteristics related to childhood trauma that appear to last for long periods of life, no matter what diagnosis the patient eventually receives. These are visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories of the traumatic event, repetitive behaviors, trauma-specific fears, and changed attitudes about people, life, and the future. She divides childhood trauma into two basic types and defines the findings that can be used to characterize each of these types. Type I trauma includes full, detailed memories, \"omens,\" and misperceptions. Type II trauma includes denial and numbing, self-hypnosis and dissociation, and rage. Crossover conditions often occur after sudden, shocking deaths or accidents that leave children handicapped. In these instances, characteristics of both type I and type II childhood traumas exist side by side. There may be considerable sadness. Each finding of childhood trauma discussed by the author is illustrated with one or two case examples. ',\n",

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in cities with populations of more than 1 million has not been studied adequately. This study was undertaken to determine the overall survival rate for Chicago and the effect of previously reported variables on survival, and to compare the observed survival rates with those previously reported. DESIGN: Consecutive prehospital arrest patients were studied prospectively during 1987. SETTING: The study area was the city of Chicago, which has more than 3 million inhabitants in 228 square miles. The emergency medical services system, with 55 around-the-clock ambulances and 550 paramedics, is single-tiered and responds to more than 200,000 emergencies per year. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: We studied 3,221 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest on whom paramedics attempted resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of patients were pronounced dead in emergency departments, 7% died in hospitals, and 2% survived to hospital discharge. Survival was significantly greater with bystander-witnessed arrest, bystander-initiated CPR, paramedic-witnessed arrest, initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, and shorter treatment intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival rates were significantly lower than those reported in most previous studies, all based on smaller communities; they were consistent with the rates reported in the one comparable study of a large city. The single factor that most likely contributed to the poor overall survival was the relatively long interval between collapse and defibrillation. Logistical, demographic, and other special characteristics of large cities may have affected the rates. To improve treatment of cardiac arrest in large cities and maximize the use of community resources, we recommend further study of comparable metropolitan areas using standardized terms and methodology. Detailed analysis of each component of the emergency medical services systems will aid in making improvements to maximize survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ',\n",

Of 153 patients presenting with acute transient amnesia, 114 fulfilled the proposed strict diagnostic criteria for transient global amnesia (TGA). The prognosis of this group was excellent with the exception of a small subgroup (7%), largely identifiable because of atypically brief or recurrent attacks, who developed epilepsy of temporal lobe type on follow up. Computerised tomography (CT) scans performed on 95 patients were normal, evidence for covert alcoholism was lacking and there was a familial incidence of approximately 2%. By contrast, the group of 39 patients who did not meet the criteria for TGA had a significantly worse prognosis with a high incidence of major vascular events. The groups could not be distinguished on the basis of behavioural characteristics during the attack. The following classification was proposed: 1) pure TGA--attacks fulfilling the strict criteria, and of more than one hour in duration which do not require detailed investigation, 2) probable epileptic amnesia--attacks of less than an hour or rapidly recurrent, 3) probable transient ischaemic amnesia, a minority of cases with additional focal neurological deficits during the attack.

The present study compared in vitro the motor responses of human and rabbit distal colonic longitudinal and circular muscle to acetylcholine, histamine, leukotrienes B4 and D4, and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha. The active and passive mechanical properties of these muscles were also evaluated. All muscle types were contracted by acetylcholine and histamine. Longitudinal muscle from both species was contracted by prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha, although rabbit muscle was more sensitive. Prostaglandin E2 relaxed the majority of both human and rabbit circular muscle preparations that were studied. Prostaglandin F2 alpha first relaxed and then contracted circular muscle from both species. Leukotriene B4 had no effect on any tissue studied. Leukotriene D4 caused transient relaxations in a proportion of all muscle types, but the relaxations were not concentration-related. Contractile responses did not differ under isotonic recording conditions, but relaxations were much more clearly defined. Based on experiments using atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, and pyrilamine or tetrodotoxin, it was concluded that the responses of both human and rabbit distal colonic muscles to these inflammatory mediators have a similar pharmacological basis. All muscle types exhibited low passive tension and developed active tension in the range 0.8-1.2 Lo. These data strongly support the belief that after the onset of an induced colitis, the rabbit colon has value as a predictive model for the study of inflammatory mediator-induced colonic motility changes in humans.

Twenty-two patients (44%) were imaged within 3 days after clinical ictus. Abnormalities detected with gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement were observed in 46 (92%) of 50 patients. Classic parenchymal enhancement was a late finding, observed in all patients (17 of 17) imaged at 7-14 days after infarction. Before this time, three additional phases of contrast material-related abnormalities were observed. Enhancement of vessels supplying the infarct (\"intravascular enhancement sign\") was the earliest finding, seen in 17 (77%) of 22 infarcts aged 1-3 days. From day 2 to day 6, abnormal enhancement of meninges adjacent to the infarct was frequently noted (\"meningeal enhancement sign\"). Finally, a transition phase that combined intravascular or meningeal enhancement with early parenchymal enhancement was seen from day 3 to day 6. Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging in early stroke reveals evidence of vascular engorgement and sluggish flow, which precede the development of classic parenchymal enhancement. ',\n",

The median duration of rehabilitation stay was 49 days. The mean functional independence score, as measured on a modified Barthel Index at admission was 44, compared with 78 on discharge, a mean improvement of 34. Stair climbing had the lowest mean value on admission (12), while bowel control had the lowest residual deficit on discharge (95). The stroke study group was representative of the unimpaired aged population in all respects except ethnicity, where differences are attributed to age.

In 15 spontaneously breathing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) divided into two groups, one with normocapnia (A) and one with chronic hypercapnia (B), we evaluated the maximal voluntary inspiratory muscle strength (MIP), the pattern of breathing, the mouth occlusion pressure (Po.1), the neural respiratory drive (NRD), assessed by surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the diaphragm (EMGd) and EMG activity of intercostal muscles (EMGint), and the chest wall neuromuscular coupling, assessed in terms of Po.1/EMGd ratio. Compared with an age-matched normal control group, both A and B groups exhibited lower MIP, significantly greater EMGd and EMGint, and lower Po.1/EMGd ratio. However, a similar pattern, along with a rapid and shallow breathing, differentiated group B from group A. In group B we found a significant direct relationship between Po.1/EMGd ratio and MIP, and an inverse relationship between PaCO2 and Po.1/EMGd ratio. These data seem to indicate the following: (1) EMG is a more precise method than Po.1 in assessing the magnitude of the NRD; (2) NRD is increased in these patients; and (3) clinical manifestations probably associated with inspiratory muscle fatigue (marked decrease in muscle strength, rapid and shallow breathing, and alveolar hypoventilation) may be accompanied by a greater NRD and a more marked derangement in chest wall neuromuscular coupling in COPD.

Seventeen consecutive patients undergoing 20 planned aortic valve replacements with allograft valves at Stanford University Medical Center were studied with intraoperative epicardial echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Native aortic valves were replaced in 12 of the 20 patients, and eight patients underwent second aortic valve procedures. In 17 of 20 patients allograft selection was guided by prebypass echocardiographic estimates of annular diameter and/or length of allograft aortic root required. Other prebypass findings included unanticipated severe mitral regurgitation in one patient (which precluded allograft aortic valve replacement), left-to-right shunts in five patients, ascending aortic dissection in one, and aortic root disease necessitating coronary reimplantation or bypass in two. Postbypass echocardiography demonstrated acceptable competency of 18 of 19 allograft valves (mild or no aortic insufficiency). Postbypass echocardiography also documented successful repair of four of five shunts and mild mitral regurgitation in 15 of 19 patients (versus 11 of 19 before bypass). Conclusions: Intraoperative echocardiography-Doppler mapping is a useful adjunct for allograft aortic valve or aortic root replacement; it allows confident selection of appropriate tissue size before aortic cross clamping, which minimizes delay from allograft thawing procedures. It also provides helpful information about the extent of aortic root disease and coronary ostial anatomy before bypass, confirms allograft competency after bypass, and detects accompanying valvular and other hemodynamic lesions before and after allograft valve replacement.

       " 376: 'A 170-kDa membrane-bound protease is associated with the expression of invasiveness by human malignant melanoma cells. Malignant spreading of cancer cells requires cell surface proteases that cleave the crosslinked collagenous matrix of connective tissues. From correlating the morphologically defined invasiveness of tumor cells with the presence of specific membrane-associated proteases, we have identified a malignant human melanoma cell line, LOX, that invades crosslinked gelatin films in vitro and contains uniquely a neutral 170-kDa gelatinase in the cell membrane. A similar gelatinase was found in membranes recovered from culture media conditioned with LOX. The 170-kDa gelatinase is a wheat germ agglutinin-binding protein. The proteolytic activity is maximal at neutral pH, enhanced by EDTA and dithiothreitol, inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide, HgCl2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and can bind to an organomercurial adsorbent, suggesting that it is a neutral sulfhydryl-sensitive protease. This 170-kDa gelatinase of LOX cells was not found in a control melanoma cell line, SK-MEL28, or in 32 other tumor cell lines that did not show extracellular gelatin degradation. Thus, we have identified a large membrane-bound protease that may be a specific marker molecule for melanoma cell invasiveness. ',\n",

Percutaneous catheter ablation using radiofrequency energy can be used to interrupt atrioventricular (AV) conduction in patients with supraventricular tachycardia refractory to drugs. Results of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction using a custom-designed catheter with a large, 3-mm-long distal electrode, 2-mm interelectrode spacing, and a shaft with increased torsional rigidity were compared with those using a standard quadripolar electrode catheter (Bard EP). An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied unmodulated radiofrequency current at 550 kHz, which was applied between the distal electrode of the ablation catheter and a large skin electrode. With use of the modified catheter, 12 of 13 patients (92%) had persistent complete AV block induced with 7 +/- 5 applications of 18 +/- 6 W of radiofrequency power. In contrast, complete AV block was produced in only 9 of 18 (50%) historical control patients treated with the standard catheter, despite a similar number of applications (7 +/- 5) and power output (16 +/- 4 W). A rise in impedance, due to desiccation of tissue and coagulum formation, occurred earlier (28 +/- 18 vs 52 +/- 24 seconds, p less than 0.001) and more frequently (54 vs 40% of applications, p = 0.047) in patients treated with the standard catheter than in patients treated with the modified catheter. The use of a catheter designed to increase the surface area of electrode-tissue contact allows more radiofrequency energy to be delivered before a rise in impedance occurs and appears to increase the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction.

From 31 December 1984 to 31 December 1988, 27 of these patients underwent subsequent surgical correction. Age at operation ranged from 7 to 58 months (median 2.7 years). The mean interval between balloon dilatation and correction was 15.6 months (range 3-39 months). Two patients had a systemic pulmonary shunt operation performed before dilatation and a further five required one afterwards. Overall 20 (74%) patients had some anatomical alteration as the result of balloon dilatation, while in seven (26%) there was no discernible change in the right ventricular outflow tract. There was no consistent relation between the ratio of balloon size to pulmonary annulus diameter and the morphological findings. Balloon dilatation may obviate the need for systemic-pulmonary shunt at the expense of some structural damage, particularly to the posterior cusp.

It is a vast network of neurons widely dispersed throughout the gut. The ENS is a dominant regulator of gut function through the action of peptide and non-peptide neurotransmitters. The most intensively studied roles of the ENS have been the regulation of secretory processes, such as gastric acid secretion, and motility. It is clear, however, that the ENS plays a broader role in the regulation of other gut functions, including mucosal defense, the gut immune response, and sphincter function. Alterations in the regulation of gut function by the ENS are likely or suspected in a number of conditions, including achalasia, Hirschsprung's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Chagas' disease, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, biliary dyskinesia, tachygastria, and irritable bowel syndrome.

The relationship between opioid plasma concentration and analgesic effect was well defined for alfentanil but ambiguous for morphine. Fentanyl exhibited a marked hysteresis. We observed noteworthy individual differences in analgesic response with all 3 drugs but these differences were greatest for morphine and least for alfentanil. Inter- and intrasubject variability in analgesic response across drugs is related to the physicochemical properties of the drugs tested. ',\n",

The effects of the new arterial and venous vasodilator flosequinan have been evaluated in a variety of ways in different groups of patients with chronic heart failure. Flosequinan improved the central hemodynamic effects of heart failure in one group, with benefits still apparent up to 24 hours after a single oral dose. In another group it also improved calf blood flow and, therefore, blood flow to skeletal muscle. Also, using a number of different tests, it improved the exercise performance of the patients. In a further group the improvement in exercise tolerance produced was similar to that of captopril. Flosequinan has the necessary properties of a drug that is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure. ',\n",

Breast tumor cell lines have been shown to secrete several distinct polypeptide growth factors, although conflicting results exist for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In contrast a limited number of breast tumor cell lines have definitely been shown to secrete the high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that modify IGF actions. To characterize the types of IGFBPs that are secreted by breast tumor cell lines, conditioned medium was collected from seven separate tumor cell lines, three of which were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and four of which were ER positive. All three of the ER negative cell lines, MDA-231, MDA-330, and HS578T, secreted binding proteins of 49,000 and 43,000 Mr (IGFBP-3) as well as 29,000 (IGFBP-1) and 24,000 Mr. In contrast, all four ER positive cell lines secreted 34,000 (IGFBP-2) or 24,000 Mr forms, and none secreted the 49,000 and 43,000 or 29,000 Mr forms. BT-20, a cell line that is positive for ER messenger RNA (mRNA) but negative for ER protein, secreted predominantly a 34,000 Mr protein. The amount of total IGFBP activity released in 24 h ranged between 0.4 and 5.6 nM equivalents of IGFBP-1, and there was no significant difference between the ER positive and negative cell lines. The MCF-7 cells that produced predominantly 34,000 and 24,000 Mr forms showed a 1.8-fold increase in IGFBP secretion after estrogen stimulation. Immunoblotting and a specific RIA for IGFBP-1 showed that only the ER negative lines MDA-330, MDA-231, and HS578T secreted this form. Northern blotting analysis for the mRNA encoding this protein showed that both MDA-330 and MDA-231 contained a single 1.6 kilobase mRNA species that hybridized with an IGFBP-1 complementary DNA (cDNA) probe. Immunoblotting analysis of the other cell lines showed that only the 34,000 Mr form secreted by the ER positive cell lines reacted with IGFBP-2 antisera. Exposure of the conditioned media from the three ER negative cell lines to N-glycanase revealed that the 49,000 and 43,000 Mr forms of IGFBP were glycosylated and therefore probably represent IGFBP-3. We conclude that ER negative cell lines secrete three forms of IGFBPs, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and a 24,000 Mr form. In contrast, the ER positive cell lines secrete predominantly IGFBP-2 and the 24,000 Mr form but do not secrete IGFBP-3 or 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). ',\n",

Neurohormonal factors were investigated in 10 patients with functional dyspepsia who had normal or slow upper gut transit and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Gastric and small bowel motility and transit, jejunal responses to luminal distention and IM neostigmine, gut hormones, and vagal and sympathetic functions were studied. Slow upper gut transit was defined by a gastric emptying slope less than 0.3%/min or 10% small bowel transit time greater than 300 minutes. Four patients with slow transit had reduced postprandial antral motility and gut hormone responses. Two of the four patients had vagal and sympathetic dysfunction. In 6 patients with normal transit, balloon distention in the jejunum was perceived at a lower volume (32.7 +/- 5.9 mL) than in controls (46.6 +/- 3.0 mL). Pressure responses to balloon distention were reduced in 5 and exaggerated in 1 patient; abnormal efferent vagal (2 patients) and sympathetic (1 patient) function were also documented. In view of the normal transit, motility, and jejunal pressure responses to neostigmine in all 6 patients, the abnormal response to distention suggests afferent dysfunction. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogenous disorder. Abnormal transit is sometimes associated with disorders of extrinsic neural control, but the latter are also found in patients with normal transit. Increased perception of intraluminal stimuli in those with normal transit suggests a disturbance in afferent function. ',\n",

Systemic administration of the cytokine, TGF beta 1, profoundly antagonized the development of polyarthritis in susceptible rats. TGF beta 1 administration (1 or 5 micrograms/animal), initiated one day before an arthritogenic dose of streptococcal cell wall (SCW) fragments, virtually eliminated the joint swelling and distortion typically observed during both the acute phase (articular index, AI = 2.5 vs. 11; P less than 0.025) and the chronic phase (AI = 0 vs. 12.5) of the disease. Moreover, TGF beta 1 suppressed the evolution of arthritis even when administration was begun after the acute phase of the disease. Histopathological examination of the joint revealed the systemic TGF beta 1 treatment greatly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus formation, and joint erosion. Consistent with the inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment into the synovium, TGF beta 1 reversed the leukocytosis associated with the chronic phase of the arthritis. Control animals subjected to the same TGF beta 1 dosing regimen displayed no discernable immunosuppressive or toxic effects even after 4 wk of treatment. These observations not only provide insight into the immunoregulatory effects of TGF beta, but also implicate this cytokine as a potentially important therapeutic agent. ',\n",

To determine the role of thrombin in high blood flow, platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes we measured the relative antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects in baboons of hirudin, a highly potent and specific antithrombin, and compared the effects of heparin, an antithrombin III-dependent inhibitor of thrombin. Thrombus formation was determined in vivo using three relevant models (homologous endarterectomized aorta, collagen-coated tubing, and Dacron vascular graft) by measuring: (1) platelet deposition, using gamma camera imaging of 111In-platelets; (2) fibrin deposition, as assessed by the incorporation of circulating 125I-fibrinogen; and (3) occlusion. The continuous intravenous infusion of 1, 5, and 20 nmol/kg per minute of recombinant hirudin (desulfatohirudin) maintained constant plasma levels of 0.16 +/- 0.03, 0.79 +/- 0.44, and 3.3 +/- 0.77 mumol/mL, respectively. Hirudin interrupted platelet and fibrin deposition in a dose-dependent manner that was profound at the highest dose for all three thrombogenic surfaces and significant at the lowest dose for thrombus formation on endarterectomized aorta. Thrombotic occlusion was prevented by all doses studied. In contrast, heparin did not inhibit either platelet or fibrin deposition when administered at a dose that maximally prolonged clotting times (100 U/kg) (P greater than .1), and only intermediate effects were produced at 10-fold that dose (1,000 U/kg). Moreover, heparin did not prevent occlusion of the test segments. Hirudin inhibited platelet hemostatic function in concert with its antithrombotic effects (bleeding times were prolonged by the intermediate and higher doses). By comparison, intravenous heparin failed to affect the bleeding time at the 100 U/kg dose (P greater than .5), and only minimally prolonged the bleeding time at the 1,000 U/kg dose (P less than .05). We conclude that platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes are thrombin-mediated and that the biologic antithrombin hirudin produces a potent, dose-dependent inhibition of arterial thrombus formation that greatly exceeds the minimal antithrombotic effects produced by heparin.

Decreased cell mediated cytotoxicity occurs frequently in inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in patients with active disease. It is not clear, however, whether this decrease is caused by the disease or is a consequence of the medical treatment. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in five patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission and in four healthy control subjects in a double blind randomised crossover trial preceded and separated by four weeks of treatment with placebo. The natural killer cell activity was significantly impaired in 67% (six of nine subjects) after four weeks' sulphasalazine treatment and tended to be related to subjects with a slow acetylator phenotype. In contrast, 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment caused only a marginal reaction in the natural killer cell activity in 22% (two of nine subjects). The inhibitory effects were found to be reversible since the decreased natural killer cell activity was completely restored after placebo treatment in all subjects. In conclusion, in vivo treatment with sulphasalazine inhibits the in vitro natural killer cell activity and this seems to be mediated by the sulphapyridine moiety. This phenomenon may contribute to the low natural killer cell activity found in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. \",\n",

Chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by fusion of the bcr and abl genes on chromosomes 22 and 9, respectively. In most cases, the fusion involves a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), which produces the cytogenetically distinctive Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Fusion can be detected by Southern (DNA) analysis or by in vitro amplification of the messenger RNA from the fusion gene with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques are sensitive but cannot be applied to single cells. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with probes from portions of the bcr and abl genes to detect the bcr-abl fusion in individual blood and bone marrow cells from six patients. The fusion event was detected in all samples analyzed, of which three were cytogenetically Ph1-negative. One of the Ph1-negative samples was also PCR-negative. This approach is fast and sensitive, and provides potential for determining the frequency of the abnormality in different cell lineages. ',\n",

Intraoperative administration of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin causes reduction in blood loss and homologous blood requirement in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. To ascertain the blood-saving effect of aprotinin and to obtain further information about the mode of action, 40 patients undergoing primary myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to receive either aprotinin or placebo treatment. Aprotinin was given as a bolus of 2 x 10(6) kallikrein inactivator units (KIU) before surgery followed by a continuous infusion of 5 x 10(5) KIU/h during surgery. Additionally, 2 x 10(6) KIU were added to the pump prime. Strict criteria were used to obtain a homogeneous patient selection. Total blood loss was reduced from 1,431 +/- 760 ml in the control group to 738 +/- 411 ml in the aprotinin group (P less than 0.05) and the homologous blood requirement from 838 +/- 963 ml to 163 +/- 308 ml (P less than 0.05).

Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is invasive, rapidly performed, cheap, and accurate and has a primary role in documenting intra-abdominal bleeding or contamination in hypotensive patients with blunt trauma or selected stable patients with penetrating stab wounds. It misses small and large injuries to the diaphragm and cannot rule out injury to retroperitoneal structures. Computed tomography is noninvasive, time consuming to perform, expensive, and accurate and has a primary role in defining the location and magnitude of intra-abdominal injuries in stable patients with blunt trauma or with penetrating trauma to the flank or back. In many hospitals, it misses gastrointestinal perforations or ruptures.

The mice were randomly divided into four groups: group IA (LAK + IL-2) (N = 25) received 2 X 10(7) human lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from normal donors by tail vein injection followed by 10,000 units of human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) given intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 28 days; group IB (IL-2) (N = 27) was given the same dose of IL-2 alone; group IC (RPMI-1640) (N = 18) received a placebo consisting of 1 ml of RPMI-1640 intraperitoneally every 12 hours; and group ID (LAK) (N = 14) received 2 X 10(7) LAK cells but no IL-2. Toxicity was significantly higher in group IB, with a mortality rate of 45.5% (10/22 animals) versus a 0% mortality (0/25) in group IA. None of the group IA or IB animals died of pancreatic cancer during the experiment. The animals that did not receive IL-2 died before 28 days in 14.2% of group IC and in 16.7% of group ID. The area under the growth curve of subcutaneous tumors during the course of treatment and the pancreatic tumor weight at the end of treatment were compared in each group. Subcutaneous tumors had a reduced rate of growth in group IA animals compared to all the other treatments. Pancreatic tumor growth was slowed in group IA. The animals treated with IL-2 alone (group IB) showed some slowing of tumor growth that was intermediate between group IA, group IC, and group ID. A similar experiment was done with irradiated (375 rad) mice. Nine nude mice with tumors were treated with LAK + IL-2 (group IIA), eight received IL-2 alone (group IIB), and seven received placebo (group IIC). The antitumor effect of IL-2 alone was not present in the irradiated mice. A highly significant difference persisted between group IIA and all other groups. There was no difference in the histologic characteristics of tumors in control mice and in mice with inhibited tumor growth treated with IL-2 or IL-2 and human LAK cells. These results show that adoptive immunotherapy with human LAK cells and human recombinant IL-2 is effective against human pancreatic cancer growing in nude mice. This effect is independent from antitumor activity from IL-2 administrations alone. ',\n",

In seven (54%) of these 13 patients, stroke occurred less than or equal to 5 years after systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed. Among the predisposing risk factors for stroke, hypertension was the most important. Lupus anticoagulant was detected in three (38%) and anticardiolipin antibody in three (43% of seven investigated) of the patients with infarction. Evaluation of the clinical manifestations and autoantibodies indicated that renal involvement and high titers of anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibody were more frequent in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group. Autopsy studies on six of the patients with stroke revealed small infarcts and hemorrhages in all, but in no case was true angiitis observed. Libman-Sacks endocarditis was found in two of the three patients with infarction.

Lack of information regarding the presence of native albumin polymer in serum and its structural similarity to the one produced by glutaraldehyde treatment casts doubt on the postulate that hepatitis B virus attachment to hepatocytes is mediated through polymerized albumin. We used a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with murine monoclonal antibodies raised against glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin to detect native albumin polymer in human serum and its cross-reactivity with other albumin polymers. Presence of polymerized albumin receptor on the HepG2 cell was studied by radioreceptor assay. Purified hepatitis B virus and synthetic peptide analogous to part of pre-S2 sequence (120-145) were used to study polymerized albumin-dependent attachment of the virus to HepG2 cells. Antibodies raised against pre-S2 peptide were used to inhibit the pre-S2 and hepatitis B virus attachment to HepG2 cells. Glutaraldehyde-treated polymerized albumin was found to be immunologically cross-reactive with native albumin polymer. Its levels were found to be significantly raised in sera of patients with liver diseases. Polymerized albumin has specific saturable receptor on HepG2 cells with two classes of binding sites of different equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd1 = (16 +/- 9.6)pmol/L and Kd2 = (1,019 +/- 172)pmol/L.

Resting energy expenditure and plasma catecholamines were normal in all three groups. The basal rate of glycerol appearance in blood in the patients with cancer (2.96 +/- 0.45 mumol.kg-1.min-1) was similar to that in the nutritionally matched controls (3.07 +/- 0.28 mumol.kg-1.min-1), but 48% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers (2.00 +/- 0.16 mumol.kg-1.min-1) (P = 0.028). The antilipolytic effect of propranolol and the rate of triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in the patients with cancer were also similar in the cachectic control group and approximately 50% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers, but the differences were not statistically significant because of the variability in the data. We conclude that the increase in lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in \"unstressed\" cachectic patients with esophageal cancer is due to alterations in their nutritional status rather than the presence of tumor itself.

Vagotomy, pyloroplasty and underrunning of the bleeding point was performed in 101 cases with ten deaths (10 per cent), partial (Billroth II) gastrectomy in 81 cases with ten deaths (12 per cent), and vagotomy and antrectomy in 16 cases with one death (6 per cent). A patient was more likely to be treated by partial gastrectomy if a giant ulcer with an internal diameter of greater than or equal to 2 cm was found. The results suggest that while vagotomy and pyloroplasty, combined with a direct attack on the bleeding point or excision of an anterior ulcer is an acceptable standard emergency operation for bleeding duodenal ulcer, gastric resection proved to be a satisfactory alternative procedure and should be considered in the technically difficult case with a very large ulcer. A giant ulcer was present in 37 per cent of cases coming to surgery. ',\n",

Field studies in Bangladesh demonstrated that after proper training, village mothers were able to prepare and use rice-based, salt-enriched oral rehydration solutions containing safe concentrations of sodium, and were capable of achieving significantly fewer treatment failures and a reduction in the duration of diarrhea than with glucose-based oral rehydration solutions (ORS). An additional longitudinal study showed that improved growth and weight gain occurred with the consistent use of ORS; the effect was greater when rice-based ORS were used. In addition, the following possible limitations and benefits of cereal-based oral rehydration therapy, which are relevant to the strategies for its implementation in national diarrheal disease control programs, are discussed: safety, osmolarity, hypernatremia, spoiling, effectiveness, rehydration ability, reduction in diarrhea volume and duration, nutritional effects, effect on food intake, acceptance and usage by care givers, training of health workers, self-reliance of families, effect on other child survival activities, costs, potential problems in changing to cereal-based ORS, and the role of industrial production in packaged cereal-based ORS.

PURPOSE: Patients with chest pain but without angiographic evidence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) are often found to have other medical or psychiatric disorders, including mitral valve prolapse, panic disorder (PD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of comorbidity between MDD/PD and mitral valve prolapse in a group of patients with non-CAD chest pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography for suspected CAD who were 70 years of age or younger and without other significant medical illnesses or cardiac complications were eligible for study. The first 100 patients who agreed to a psychiatric diagnostic interview were recruited. RESULTS: Forty-eight of the 100 patients were found to be without significant CAD. Forty-two percent of these patients, compared to 19% of the patients with significant CAD, were found to have either MDD, PD, or both. Eighty percent of the patients without CAD who had mitral valve prolapse also had either MDD or PD (p less than 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The finding that mitral valve prolapse was significantly associated with MDD/PD has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-CAD chest pain, and may explain why these patients complain of symptoms.

Chromosome aberrations that might be diagnostic have been identified in some types of soft-tissue tumors, but the overall frequency and diagnostic relevance of these aberrations have not been established. METHODS. We attempted to determine the karyotypes of a series of 62 consecutive, unselected malignant spindle-cell or small round-cell soft-tissue tumors (from 46 adults and 16 children) after direct harvesting of cells or short-term culture. All tumors were examined independently by immunohistochemical staining in addition to routine light-microscopical evaluation, and all but two tumors were examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS. Metaphases were obtained from 61 of the 62 tumors, and clonal chromosome aberrations were identified in 55 (89 percent). In the six tumors that yielded metaphases but lacked apparent clonal aberrations, the normal metaphases were found to originate from non-neoplastic stromal elements within the tumor specimens. Thus, all tumors in which karyotyping was successful contained clonal chromosome aberrations. Forty of 62 tumors (65 percent) contained clonal chromosome aberrations that either suggested or confirmed a specific diagnosis; in 15 of these tumors (24 percent of all tumors), the aberrations were important in establishing the final diagnosis. Cytogenetic analyses were particularly informative about small round-cell tumors from children: 8 of 14 round-cell tumors contained diagnostically important chromosome aberrations. Using the combined approaches of light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics, we established an unambiguous diagnosis for 60 of 62 tumors. CONCLUSIONS. Cytogenetic analyses reveal clonal chromosome aberrations in virtually all malignant soft-tissue tumors. These clonal chromosome aberrations, particularly in small round-cell tumors in children, often have diagnostic relevance. ',\n",

The protective effect of low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution on ischemic myocardium has been assessed in adult patients undergoing heart operations. Postreperfusion recovery of cardiac function and electrical activity was evaluated in 34 patients; 16 received low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution (group I) and 18 received St. Thomas' Hospital solution, which is enriched with calcium and magnesium (group II). There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, sex, body weight, and New York Heart Association functional class. Aortic occlusion time (107.3 +/- 46.8 minutes versus 113.6 +/- 44.3 minutes), highest myocardial temperature during elective global ischemia (11.5 degrees C +/- 3.1 degrees C versus 9.3 degrees C +/- 3.2 degrees C), and total volume of cardioplegic solution (44.2 +/- 20.5 ml/kg versus 43.4 +/- 17.6 ml/kg) were also similar in the two groups. On reperfusion, electrical defibrillation was required in four cases (25.5%) in group I and in 15 cases (83.3%) in group II (p less than 0.005), and bradyarrhythmias were significantly more prevalent in group II (6.3% versus 44.4%; p less than 0.05). Serum creatine kinase MB activity at 15 minutes of reperfusion (12.3 +/- 17.0 IU/L versus 42.6 +/- 46.1 IU/L; p less than 0.05) and the dose of dopamine or dobutamine required during the early phase of reperfusion (1.8 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg/min versus 6.1 +/- 3.3 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.0002) were both significantly greater in group II. Postischemic left ventricular function, as assessed by percent recovery of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement alone, was significantly better in group I (160.4% +/- 45.5% versus 47.8% +/- 12.9%; p less than 0.05). Serum level of calcium and magnesium ions was significantly lower in group I. Thus low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution provided excellent protection of the ischemic heart, whereas St. Thomas' Hospital solution with calcium and magnesium enabled relatively poor functional and electrical recovery of the heart during the early reperfusion period. These results might be related to differing levels of extracellular calcium and magnesium on reperfusion. \",\n",

Retrospective review of 291 solid tumor and lymphoma patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed to determine the influence of pretransplant characteristics and preparative regimen to the development of hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD). Twelve patients (4.1%) developed a clinical syndrome of right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness or hepatomegaly, jaundice, and ascites, with or without encephalopathy, within 40 days of marrow reinfusion. Evidence of metastatic liver disease was the only pretransplant characteristic predictive for VOD (P = .0002). Sex, age, histology, hepatitis B serology, and elevated liver function tests were not predictive. No individual preparative agent had a significant effect on the development of VOD. However, a single 2-hour infusion of carmustine (BCNU) (greater than or equal to 450 mg/m2) led to an increased incidence of VOD when compared with the same dose administered in a fractionated schedule (P = .0258) when given with two other chemotherapeutic agents. Seven of eight autopsy specimens confirmed the clinical diagnosis of VOD. The four patients in whom clinical VOD resolved had lower median peak bilirubins (7.3 v 15.9 mg/dL), lower median peak creatinines (2.1 v 4.1 mg/dL), and relatively quick engraftment of neutrophils (mean, 18.7 days). One of the four patients in whom VOD resolved had other grade 4 (life-threatening) toxicities in contrast to eight of eight who succumbed. In summary, VOD is an uncommon complication in autotransplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas. Our data suggest caution in selecting patients with known metastatic liver disease and consideration of a fractionated BCNU schedule especially in combination with other alkylating agents. ',\n",

In a randomized, prospective trial, a low-molecular-weight heparinoid (Org 10172 [Lomoparan]) was compared with warfarin for efficacy and safety in preventing deep-vein thrombosis in 263 patients who had an operatively treated fracture of the hip. One group of patients received Org 10172 in a dose of 750 units subcutaneously every twelve hours until the ninth postoperative day; on the seventh postoperative day, warfarin was added to the regimen. The other group received only warfarin. Both drugs were begun preoperatively, immediately after the admission evaluation. In the patients who received warfarin, the desired prothrombin time was one and one-half times the control level. Deep-vein thrombosis was detected by 125I-fibrinogen scanning and impedance plethysmography and was confirmed by phlebography and compression ultrasonography. Deep-vein thrombosis was found in nine (7 per cent) of the 132 patients who received Org 10172 and in twenty-eight (21 per cent) of the 131 patients who received warfarin (p less than 0.001). Adverse reactions were not significantly different in the two groups. Major bleeding complications occurred in eight patients in the Org-10172 group, only four of whom were receiving the drug at the time of bleeding, and in five patients who were receiving warfarin (not significant). There was no difference in intraoperative loss of blood or in requirements for transfusion. We concluded that the low-molecular-weight heparinoid Org 10172 is a safe, convenient, effective antithrombotic agent for the prevention of venous thrombosis after an operation for fracture of the hip.

Recent advances in miniaturization of phased-array and mechanical ultrasound devices have resulted in exploration of alternative approaches to cardiac and vascular imaging in the form of transesophageal or intravascular imaging. Preliminary efforts in adapting phased-array endoscopes designed for transesophageal use to a transvascular approach have used full-sized phased-array devices introduced directly into the right atrium in open-chested animals. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a custom-made, very small phased-array endoscope for intracardiac imaging introduced intravascularly through a jugular venous approach in young piglets. METHODS AND RESULTS. Experimental atrial septal defects created in four piglets (3-4 weeks old) had been closed with a buttoned atrial septal defect closure device consisting of an occluder in the left atrium and a counteroccluder in the right atrium. Five to 15 days after atrial septal defect closure, the piglets were returned to the experimental laboratory, where a 6.3-mm, 17-element, 5-MHz phased-array probe mounted on a 4-mm endoscope was introduced through a cutdown incision of the external jugular vein and advanced to the right atrium. From the right atrium all four cardiac chambers, their inflows and outflows, and all four valves were well imaged with minimal superior and inferior rotation. High-resolution imaging of the atrial septum defined with anatomical accuracy, later verified by autopsy, the exact placement of both the occluder and counteroccluder in the left and right sides of the atrial septal defects and the absence of any shunting across the atrial septum in any of the four animals. CONCLUSIONS. Our efforts indicate that transvascular passage of small phased-array probes can be easily accomplished and is a promising technique for detailed visualization of cardiac structures. This approach may provide an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography, particularly for guiding interventional procedures such as placement of transcatheter closure devices in pediatric patients.

Fundoplication with gastrostomy has become a frequent treatment for patients with familial dysautonomia, so we evaluated the use of both procedures in 65 patients. Although patients differed widely in presenting signs and age, from 5 weeks to 40 years, gastroesophageal reflux was documented in 95% of patients by cineradiography or pH monitoring. Panendoscopy was a useful adjunct. Preoperative symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux included vomiting, respiratory infections, and exaggerated autonomic dysfunction. Severe oropharyngeal incoordination frequently coexisted and resulted in misdirected swallows with aspiration, dependence on gavage feedings, or poor weight gain and dehydration. Follow-up after surgical correction ranged from 3 months to 11 years; 55 patients (85%) were available for a 1-year postoperative assessment. We had no instances of surgical death. The long-term mortality rate was 14%, primarily related to severe preexisting respiratory disease. Beyond the first postoperative year, 30 patients had pneumonia attributed to continued aspiration, exacerbation of preexisting lung disease, or recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux. Of 11 patients who vomited postoperatively, six had recurrence of reflux. Recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux was documented in eight patients (12%), and we revised the fundoplication in three patients. The number of patients with cyclic crises was reduced from 18 to 7; retching replaced overt vomiting in all but two of these seven patients, neither of whom had recurrence of reflux. Because oropharyngeal incoordination was prominent, concomitant use of gastrostomy and an antireflux procedure was especially effective in the treatment of younger patients with familial dysautonomia, before the development of severe respiratory disease. Despite the development of severe morning nausea in 15 patients, the combination procedure resulted in significantly improved nutritional status, decreased vomiting, and decreased respiratory problems. Appropriate use of gastrostomy feedings also contributed to success of the operation. The generally good outcome of fundoplication with gastrostomy confirms the benefit of this procedure in familial dysautonomia. ',\n",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine empirically how many patients are identified as delirious or nondelirious according to DMS-III, DMS-III-R, and ICD-10 criteria. METHOD: Daily, a trained research assistant using a structured instrument to detect the presence of symptoms of delirium evaluated 325 elderly patients who were admitted to a general hospital for acute medical problems. Each patient's symptoms were then compared with these diagnostic criteria sets to determine if the patient met criteria for delirium. RESULTS: DSM-III criteria were the most inclusive: they identified 125 patients as delirious. DSM-III-R identified a somewhat different group of 106 patients as delirious. ICD-10 criteria identified only 30 patients as delirious. CONCLUSIONS: The development of new criteria for delirium (e.g., DSM-IV) will have to balance the need to define a pure group of patients for research purposes with the need to include cases of clinical interest. Changes in criteria should be based on data such as those presented in this paper. \",\n",

In 40% of cases, intraoperative pre-bypass contrast arteriography was necessary to identify a graftable tibial or pedal artery. The results of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and autogenous bypasses were compared after 1 to 3 years. After 1 year, patency was 85% and 67% for autogenous and PTFE bypasses, respectively. Limb salvage was 90% for autogenous bypass and 70% for PTFE bypass. Cumulative patency rates at 3 years were 80% for autogenous and 57% for PTFE grafts. Graft surveillance with duplex scanning and AAI was valuable in detecting failing grafts. For both types of reconstruction, secondary procedures were required to maintain patency. We attribute the excellent results with PTFE in part to long-term aspirin and warfarin therapy. In cases of combined superficial femoral and severe infra-popliteal occlusive disease, PTFE bypass is an excellent alternative when no autogenous conduit is available. ',\n",
       " 434: \"A hematologist's view of contrast media, clotting in angiography syringes and thrombosis during coronary angiography. While ionic contrast media (CM) are stronger anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, both nonionic and ionic CM retard clotting, fibrinopeptide A generation and platelet aggregation (at least by Born-O'Brien aggregometry). Thus, nonionic CM do not cause clots and thrombi. Rather, the driving force for clot or thrombus formation, when it occurs, is blood contact with and activation by the foreign surface of a syringe or catheter itself. A marked enhancement of clotting by glass syringes in comparison to plastic ones supports this view. Blood in any syringe or catheter, therefore, will clot more slowly in the presence of nonionic or ionic CM, the inhibitory effects of the latter being more profound. With respect to models of thrombosis at sites of vascular injury or stenosis, the antithrombotic effects of CM may either be transient owing to the dynamic nature of blood flow (local endothelial cell denudation model), or as in the case of ionic CM, actually to enhance local platelet aggregation (stenosis model). In these situations, preservation of the antithrombotic functions of endothelium with nonionic CM may be quite critical. \",\n",

Once calibration procedures were performed, SvO2 measured by the catheter and by an hemoximeter OSM 3 (reference value) were compared following each therapeutic intervention. Over a period of 1.5 to 6 hours during which the hematocrit value remained unchanged, 119 measurements were obtained in group 1, 91 in group 2 and 181 in group 3. The dispersion of SvO2 values was much more pronounced with the two-reference wavelength systems using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments, and the correlation coefficient was significantly higher with the three-reference wavelength system (r = 0.970 for the Oximetrix catheter vs r = 0.855 for the Edwards catheter and r = 0.826 for the Spectramed catheter, p less than 0.001). After 24 hours, the spontaneous drifts in the two-reference wavelength systems, using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments (expressed as the SvO2 value measured by the catheter minus the reference SvO2 value) were significantly higher than the spontaneous drift in the three-reference wavelength system (9.3 +/- 7 percent for the Edwards catheter and +/- 6 +/- 4.1 percent for the Spectramed catheter vs 3.3 +/- 3.1 percent for the Oximetrix catheter, p less than 0.05). This study shows that a three-wavelength system is more accurate than a two-wavelength system for measuring acute changes in SvO2.

The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a mediator of pancreatic inflammation was examined in the rat pancreatic duct ligation model of obstructive pancreatitis. Pancreatic generation of PAF, as measured by bioassay (ie, platelet [3H]serotonin secretion), was determined at various times after induction of inflammation. Tissue levels of PAF in the normal pancreas averaged 600 +/- 49 pg/g, but PAF was not detectable during the initial 24 hours of pancreatitis, a time when the inflammatory reaction would be considered acute, that is, during the period of maximal serum amylase release and the development of interstitial edema. However a substantial increase in pancreatic PAF levels (12 times control levels) was observed 7 to 14 days after duct ligation during the late-phase response interval similar to the situation characteristic of chronic pancreatitis in which parenchymal atrophy, fibrosis, and pancreatic insufficiency evolve. One week after duct ligation when PAF levels peaked, an evaluation was made of the effects of PAF antagonists (BN52021 and WEB2170) on pancreatic lesions using Evan's blue extravasation, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and acid phosphatase activity in peritoneal lavage fluid. BN52021 or WEB2170 treatment was shown to reduce pancreatic damage and inflammation significantly. Long-term in vivo administration of exogenous PAF (20 micrograms/kg/hr for 7 days) exhibited a reduction of [3H]thymidine uptake into and amylase release from pancreatic acini in vitro. Our observations 1) that pancreatic PAF levels increased significantly during the chronic phase of obstructive pancreatitis induced by duct ligation; 2) that inhibition of the action of PAF, through specific receptor antagonism, caused an attenuation of pancreatic lesions; and 3) that chronic administration of PAF resulted in decreased pancreatic regeneration and exocrine function are consistent with a pivotal role for PAF as a late-phase inflammatory mediator in chronic pancreatitis in rats. \",\n",

Whereas a perfusion defect measuring greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricle was found in 78% of patients with no prior infarction and severe (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis, this was observed in only 24% of patients with moderate stenosis. Perfusion defect size increased with increasing severity of stenosis for the entire group without infarction and for those with left anterior descending, right and circumflex coronary artery stenosis. However, the correlation between stenosis severity and perfusion defect size was at best only modest (r = 0.38, p = 0.0001). The left anterior descending artery was shown to be the most important of the three coronary arteries for providing left ventricular perfusion. Proximal stenosis of this artery produced a perfusion defect approximately twice as large as that found in patients with a proximal right or circumflex artery stenosis. However, marked heterogeneity in perfusion defect size existed among all three vessels despite comparable stenosis severity. This was most apparent for the left anterior descending coronary artery, where mid vessel stenosis commonly produced a perfusion defect similar in size to that found in proximally stenosed vessels.

Two phase 2 clinical trials of an oral superparamagnetic contrast agent for enhancement on magnetic resonance images of the intestine were performed. In trial 1, 31 male patients with cancer of the testis underwent follow-up examinations of the abdomen at 0.5 and 1.5 T after oral administration of magnetic particles. In trial 2, 31 female patients with pelvic and lower abdominal disease were examined at 1.5 T after administration of the contrast material. The patients each ingested 800 mL of contrast material over approximately 2 hours. Concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 g/L did not induce blurring or metallic artifacts. Distribution was homogeneous through the gastrointestinal tract. In all patients, a loss of signal intensity was observed on proton density-, T1-, and T2-weighted images. The diagnostic information from postcontrast images in trial 2 was greater in 16 patients (52%). Contrast enhancement was independent of field strength; no major side effects were observed. Artifacts from moving bowels were less troublesome, and delineation of intraabdominal and pelvic organs was better with the use of oral magnetic particles. ',\n",

STUDY OBJECTIVE: to determine if asymptomatic snorers have smaller pharyngeal volumes than age- and height-matched nonsnorers. DESIGN: we recruited asymptomatic heavy snorers and nonsnorers for a study. Each snorer was matched by age (+/- 3 years) and height (+/- 2 inches) with a nonsnorer. The nonsnorers were required to be near ideal body weight. All volunteers underwent overnight polysomnography, pulmonary function testing, and magnetic resonance imaging of the pharynx while awake. The volume of the pharynx was determined by a computer with data input from a digitizing instrument. SETTING: Veterans Administration Hospital and University of Florida Teaching Hospital PARTICIPANTS: Nine volunteers were recruited for both the snorer and nonsnorer groups. Each participant was paid $50. There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS and RESULTS: There were no differences in sleep variables between the two groups. There was also no significant difference between pharyngeal volumes for the two groups.

Genetically determined resistance to murine cytomegalovirus is observed in adult mice and is mediated in part by genes of the H-2 complex, with the H-2k haplotype conferring resistance. This model was used to examine the effect of primary maternal infection on fetal outcome. The severity of fetal growth retardation and death after primary maternal infection on day 8 of pregnancy was found to be genetically determined. Fetal viability and weight were significantly lower in infected BALB/c mothers (H-2d) than in CBA(H-2k) and BALB.K(H-2k) mothers. However, fetal infection was not detected, suggesting that the resistance mechanisms operate at the level of the mother or placenta. By directly inoculating fetuses in utero, it was shown that genetic factors in the fetus can influence the level of fetal infection and viability. These results point to the possibility that host genetic factors may modulate maternal and fetal cytomegalovirus infections in humans. ',\n",

       " 450: 'Clinical perspective on celiprolol: cardioprotective potential. beta-Adrenergic blockers have had widespread use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Some agents of this class have been shown to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism for this cardioprotective action is not known. Antiarrhythmic action and hemodynamic alterations have been suggested as possible mechanisms. An anticoagulant mechanism is another possibility, although the antiplatelet effects of beta-blockers are weak. It is now believed that antithrombotic effects may be related to the prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than a direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability beta-blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surgers, as they do in aortic dissection, may protect a vulnerable plaque from fracture, reducing the risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Celiprolol, a third-generation beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker with partial beta 2-agonist activity, is comparable to other beta-blockers in antihypertensive and antianginal activity. It has additional actions that may be beneficial to patients: (1) it does not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins; (2) it does not appear to depress the myocardium in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; (3) it can lower serum fibrinogen levels; and (4) it can cause regression of myocardial mass in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.

It has been proposed that among the various cell-surface proteins capable of interacting with laminin, the 67-kd high-affinity laminin receptor plays a crucial role during tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, the expression of laminin-receptor-precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and 67-kd protein was analyzed in human colon adenocarcinoma. In 22 of 23 patients with colon cancer, we found a 2- to 23-fold increase in levels of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA in the cancer tissues compared with those in matched normal adjacent colonic mucosa. In 10 of 11 cases studied, the level of 67-kd laminin receptor, detected by affinity-purified anti-laminin-receptor synthetic peptide antibodies on immunoblots of matched tumor and normal tissue extracts, was higher in the colon carcinoma tissue. Immunodetection of laminin receptor in tissue sections using anti-laminin-receptor-peptide antibodies confirmed that the increased expression of laminin receptor was specifically associated with the cancer cells. In a series of 72 paraffin sections of colon lesions, we observed a correlation between the expression of the laminin receptor and the Dukes' classification. Our observations indicate that increased expression of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA is associated with enhanced levels of the 67-kd laminin receptor as well as with the invasive phenotype of colon carcinoma. Detection of this metastasis-associated gene product may be a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of human colon cancer. \",\n",

From 1980 to 1988, the incidence of cerebral septic embolus was 42% (n = 45) among 106 patients with endocarditis who underwent valve replacement at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Of these 45 patients, 69% (n = 31) had symptomatic cerebral septic infarctions and 31% (n = 14) were asymptomatic. Findings on cerebral computed tomographic scans included ischemic infarcts (n = 36, 80%), hemorrhagic infarcts (n = 5, 11%), normal studies (n = 2, 4%), and unknown (n = 2, 4%). Neurological complications after valve replacement included postoperative strokes (n = 6, 6%), cerebral abscesses (n = 2, 2%), and seizure (n = 1, 1%).

Large caliber drainage catheters are required, and dilatation of the necessary transhepatic tracts is extremely painful unless adequate inhalation anesthesia or, preferably, epidural anesthesia, is provided. Long-term biliary drainage requires a choice between internal-external external drainage catheters and endoprostheses that is made by considering the patient's life expectancy and his or her adjustment to a stent extending to the outside.

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Relevant studies published from January 1980 to January 1990 were identified through a computerized search of the English-language literature using MEDLINE and by a manual search of the bibliographies of all identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: All randomized, controlled trials of intravenous thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina were reviewed. Smaller, observational studies and previous review articles were included when relevant to the discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: Key data were extracted from each article, including the proportions of patients eligible for thrombolysis, the reasons for exclusion from thrombolytic therapy, and the clinical outcomes of patients treated and of those excluded from treatment. The validity of certain exclusion criteria was examined using subgroup analysis from the large, randomized mortality trials of intravenous thrombolysis and observations from smaller, nonrandomized studies. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: To date, relatively few patients with myocardial infarction have been considered eligible for fibrinolytic therapy. In this group, both early and late mortality have been significantly reduced. Patients excluded from thrombolysis, however, continue to have a high early mortality. The data suggest that the potential benefits of this treatment might be extended to selected high-risk subgroups. In particular, the risk-benefit ratio may favor the inclusion of otherwise healthy elderly patients; certain patients presenting more than 6 hours after the onset of symptoms; and patients with a history of controlled systolic hypertension or brief, nontraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The data do not support the use of fibrinolytic therapy as primary treatment in patients with unstable angina or suspected myocardial infarction in the absence of confirmatory electrocardiographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: The full potential of thrombolytic therapy to alter the natural history of acute myocardial infarction can only be realized through the continued evaluation of selection criteria and the identification and treatment of the greatest possible number of eligible patients.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to cytokeratins included MAb KA 1, which binds to polypeptide 5 in a complex with polypeptide 14 and recognizes preferentially myoepithelial cells; MAb KA4, which binds to polypeptides 14, 15, 16 and 19; individual MAbs to polypeptides 7, 13, and 16, 17, 18, and 19, and the MAb mixture AE1/AE3. The authors also applied three MAbs to vimentin (Vim), and three MAbs to glial filament protein (GFP). Selected samples were studied by double-label immunofluorescence microscopy and by staining sequential sections with some of the said MAbs, an MAb to alpha-smooth muscle actin, and well-characterized polyclonal antibodies for the possible coexpression of diverse types of cytoskeletal proteins. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis also were performed. All samples reacted for cytokeratins with MAbs AE1/AE3, although the reaction did not involve all cells. Monoclonal antibody KA4 stained preferentially the luminal-secretory cells in the normal breast and in FCD, whereas it stained the vast majority of cells in all carcinomas. Monoclonal antibody KA1 stained preferentially the basal-myoepithelial cells of the normal breast and FCD while staining tumor cell subpopulations in 4 of 31 carcinomas. Vimentin-positive cells were found in 8 of 12 normal breasts and in 12 of 20 FCD; in most cases, Vim-reactive cells appeared to be myoepithelial, but occasional luminal cells were also stained. Variable subpopulations of Vim-positive cells were noted in 9 of 20 ductal and in 1 of 7 lobular carcinomas. Glial filament protein-reactive cells were found in normal breast lobules and ducts and in 15 of 20 cases of FCD; with rare exceptions, GFP-reactivity was restricted to basally located, myoepithelial-appearing cells. Occasional GFP-reactive cells were found in 3 of 31 carcinomas. Evaluation of sequential sections and double-label immunofluorescence microscopy showed the coexpression of certain cytokeratins (possibly including polypeptides 14 and 17) with vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin together with GFP in some myoepithelial cells. The presence of GFP in myoepithelial cells was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.

EPSS permanently controlled the variceal bleeding in all but one patient. In this patient, the shunt was patent as demonstrated by angiography. Esophageal varices disappeared in 18 patients and were reduced in 14. Three patients died before the endoscopic examination could be performed. The causes of death were hepatic failure in two and bleeding ulcerations of the gastric fundus in the other patient. One patient was classified in Child's category B and two in Child's category C. Thirty-two patients submitted to EPSS and were discharged alive. Twelve of these patients subsequently died, at an average of 11.2 months after undergoing the shunt procedure. Four of 12 patients died of hepatic failure; two patients died of hepatomas; two, other neoplasia; three, hemorrhaging duodenal ulcers, and one patient, renal failure. Analysis of actuarial survival rates showed that the five year survival rate was 43 per cent. The long term survival rates were fewer for patients with Child's category C than for those with combined Child's categories A and B (five year survival rates were 21 versus 55 per cent; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had variceal bleeding. Chronic encephalopathy developed in six, which was mild in three, moderate in one instance and severe in two. It developed soon after EPSS, with onset in the first month after discharge in three. Thus, when conservative treatment fails to arrest variceal bleeding, EPSS should be performed to guarantee definitive control of hemorrhage and prolong the survival period. \",\n",

The final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 54 patients and chronic pancreatitis in 27 patients. CA 19-9 assessment, US, CT, and FNAB were considered nondiagnostic, respectively, in 0%, 25%, 19%, and 6% of cases. When a definite diagnosis was rendered, the positive predictive value was 90% for CA 19-9 assessment, 95% for US, 98% for CT, and 100% for FNAB; the negative predictive value was, respectively, 69%, 95%, 86%, and 100%. The accuracy of all diagnostic and nondiagnostic studies was 81% for CA 19-9 assessment, 72% for US, 77% for CT, and 94% for FNAB.

Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients). The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy. Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy. All required flap reconstruction. Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy. Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors. Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall. Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone.

We have recently demonstrated that two chloramphenicol (CAP) metabolites known to be produced by intestinal bacteria, dehydro-CAP (DH-CAP) and nitrophenylaminopropane (NPAP), are much more cytotoxic to bone marrow in vitro than CAP itself. Since colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play an essential role in hematopoietic cell growth, toxicity from CAP metabolites could also involve interaction with CSF or CSF-producing cells. In the present study, we found that increasing concentrations of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF completely reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP (2 x 10(-4) M) on human CFU-GM growth and on the growth of KG-1 cells. GM-CSF also reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP on HL-60 cells. Inhibition by DH-CAP (50% at 5 x 10(-7) M), nitroso-CAP (NO-CAP) (60% at 5 x 10(-6) M) and NPAP (35% at 10(-5) M) was not affected by either CSF. In addition to their inhibitory effect on cell growth, DH-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) and NO-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) inhibited CSF production by buffy coat cells 50-70% without affecting cell viability. Neither CAP nor NPAP inhibited CSF production. It is suggested that the dual toxic-inhibitory effect of some intestinal metabolites of CAP such as DH-CAP on hematopoietic cell growth on the one hand, and on CSF production on the other, renders them very potent as potential mediators of CAP induced aplastic anemia.

This study has examined, in rats with taurocholate-induced pancreatitis, the efficacy of removal of the peritoneal exudate by aspiration and a single lavage, followed by instillation of an exogenous antiprotease solution. Instillation of human fresh frozen plasma, containing alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-antiprotease, was associated with the longest median survival. Aprotinin, although possessing a much greater trypsin inhibitory capacity, just failed to significantly improve the median survival time compared with the control group. Intraperitoneal antiprotease therapy is simple to perform, has a beneficial effect on survival time in this model and merits investigation in man. ',\n",

We report the development of an animal model of multiple necrotizing enteritis (MNE) in rats. When rats were injected directly with a culture supernatant of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rat peritoneal macrophages into the abdominal aorta, the overt pathologic lesions of MNE developed within 30 minutes after injection. The rats showed an elevated level of blood fibrinogen degradation product content even 30 minutes after injection. Furthermore the rats that were pretreated intravenously with heparin sulfate did not develop MNE, indicating the acute disturbances of blood microcirculation in the intestine. Multiple necrotizing enteritis was developed also by the injection with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) but rarely was observed with even a high dose of recombinant interleukin-1 (rIL-1) or platelet-activating factor (PAF). The supernatant was cytotoxic in vitro to TNF-susceptible LM and many other cells but was less cytotoxic to the TNF-resistant LR line. Partial purification of the supernatant suggested that the supernatant contained a cytokine that has biochemical features of TNF. Furthermore polyclonal anti-TNF antibody could inhibit not only the cytotoxicity in vitro but also MNE development in vivo by this factor. These data strongly indicate that MNE possibly could be caused by a TNF-like cytokine produced by macrophages that are stimulated by the endotoxin. ',\n",

We present the first pathologic descriptions of the puppet-like syndrome of Angelman based on autopsy studies of a 21-year-old woman. The noteworthy findings were a small brain with mild cerebral atrophy but normal gyral development. There was marked cerebellar atrophy with loss of Purkinje and granule cells and extensive Bergmann's gliosis. Study of dendrite morphology using Golgi impregnations of the visual cortex revealed a prominent decrease in dendritic arborization of layer 3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Quantitative Golgi analysis also revealed a significant decrease in the numbers of dendritic spines in apical layer 3 dendrites and both apical and basal layer 5 dendrites. Neurochemical studies of frozen brain tissue demonstrated markedly reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid content in the cerebellar cortex, as well as elevated glutamate content in the frontal and occipital cortices. Although there are no definite morphologic correlates of many of the clinical signs, the pronounced dendritic pathology and neurochemical abnormalities in cerebral cortex may provide a physiologic basis for mental retardation. \",\n",

Thirty-seven patients who had enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly and stabilization of the spine for cervical spondylotic myelopathy were followed for an average of forty-nine months (range, twenty-eight to seventy months). Myelography and computed tomographic myelography were performed preoperatively on all patients to determine the location and features of the areas of decompression. The canal was enlarged by discectomy; by subtotal corpectomy and removal of the anteromedial parts of the pedicles; or by removal of osteophytes or of the posterior longitudinal ligament, or both. Partial corpectomy and interbody arthrodesis was performed in nine patients; subtotal corpectomy, including removal of the posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in fifteen patients; and subtotal corpectomy, with detachment of the remaining thin posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in thirteen patients. Postoperatively, radiographic examinations, including myelography and computed tomographic myelography, were performed for thirty-six patients and magnetic resonance imaging, for twenty-eight. A satisfactory neurological result was obtained in twenty-nine patients. Atrophy of the spinal cord, as seen on preoperative computed-tomographic myelograms, was predictive of an unsatisfactory result of the decompression, as was weakness of the peroneal muscles. All but one of the thirty-seven patients had improved walking ability at the most recent follow-up examination: seventeen patients improved by 1 point; fourteen, by 2 points; four, by 3 points; and one, by 4 points. The remaining patient reverted to the preoperative status after an initial improvement. The ability to walk at the interim examinations was compared with that at the most recent examination; three patients had continuing improvement, while three others had deterioration. The main cause of deterioration was new spondylotic changes associated with stenosis of the spinal canal, occurring at the level of the disc just cephalad to the fused levels. We concluded that anterior decompression followed by a secure arthrodesis should be an extensive procedure for patients who have cervical spondylotic myelopathy, as determined preoperatively from a myelogram or computed tomographic myelogram. Excision of the vertebral bodies should also be wide and should include the anteromedial parts of the pedicles. The third or fourth cervical vertebra should be included in the arthrodesis prophylactically in patients who have stenosis of the spinal canal when either of these vertebrae is adjacent to the level of fusion.

Vitamin B6 is involved in many biological processes of potential relevance to carcinogenesis and tumor growth, including DNA synthesis and maintenance of immunocompetence, yet very little information exists on B6 nutritional status in childhood leukemia. Using a radioenzymatic assay, the authors measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of B6, in 11 newly diagnosed untreated children with leukemia and 11 age-matched controls. The children with leukemia had significantly lower PLP levels than the controls. In 26 additional leukemia patients and 26 additional controls, a high-performance liquid chromatography assay also demonstrated lower plasma PLP levels in childhood leukemia compared with controls. These differences were significant for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). The PLP values did not correlate with indices of leukemia cell burden, but did correlate with reported B6 intake, suggesting that illness-related diet changes are at least partially responsible for the low PLP levels. Before any chemotherapy, overall nutritional status was suboptimal in 53% of ALL cases and 57% of ANLL cases. Newly diagnosed children with leukemia have suboptimal overall nutrition as well as suboptimal vitamin B6 status. \",\n",

In order to investigate the effect of delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the diurnal variation of arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension, this study examined 24 h arterial pressure using an indirect or a direct monitoring system. When the effect of twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg was examined using the indirect monitoring system in 12 outpatients, delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressures significantly only at limited points during the day. However, each of the averaged 24 h daytime and nighttime arterial pressures showed significant reductions. The 24 h intraarterial pressure monitoring demonstrated that delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressure at most of the measurement points. The arterial pressure reductions during daytime and nighttime were not significantly different, that is, there was no excessive reduction in nighttime arterial pressure. Heart rate and its variability were virtually unaffected by the delapril treatment in either monitoring study. No adverse reactions were observed in the indirect or direct monitoring studies. Thus, it is concluded that twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg brings about a safe and stable antihypertensive effect, without affecting the diurnal variation of arterial pressure.

Etoposide is an important drug that has been recently incorporated with other agents in the curative treatment of patients with advanced neoplasms, including germ cell tumors, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas (NHL), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Etoposide demonstrates remarkable schedule dependency. A randomized comparison has shown an impressive survival difference for patients with extensive SCLC receiving a 5-day course versus those receiving a 1-day course. Because of these and previous clinical and laboratory data, etoposide is now given intravenously or orally in a 3-day to 5-day schedule. It is generally accepted that approximately 50% of the orally administered drug is absorbed. The authors have initiated several etoposide studies using an extended administration schedule, believing that a prolonged schedule may be superior to the standard 3-day to 5-day schedule. This was initially tested in a Phase I study. Results showed that etoposide (50 mg/m2/d) given over 21 days was feasible and was associated with only moderate toxicity. Several Phase II studies have been completed or are nearing completion, including studies in patients with SCLC, NHL, germ cell tumors, soft tissue sarcoma, renal carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Responses have been seen in all of these groups, particularly in patients with SCLC, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. In these groups we saw responses in patients who were clearly resistant to etoposide plus cisplatin given in a standard schedule or in some patients who were resistant to high-dose etoposide with bone marrow transplantation. Investigators at Indiana University Medical Center who studied oral etoposide in a similar fashion in patients with advanced germ cell tumors and SCLC achieved results similar to those reported here. The authors have initiated a number of combination chemotherapy programs using the chronic oral form of etoposide. These include patients with SCLC, non-small cell lung cancer, and elderly patients with high-grade and intermediate forms of NHL. In addition, chronic intravenous oral etoposide is being used in salvage approaches for patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and recurrent resistant intermediate-grade and high-grade NHL. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data suggest that a 50-mg/m2 oral dose is highly bioavailable (91% to 96%). Therefore, during a prolonged oral course at 50 mg/m2, many patients maintain a minimum plasma concentration of 1 microgram/ml. Further studies of multiple dose or continuous infusion etoposide to maintain a potentially critical plasma level are in progress. Etoposide administered in this way could represent a \"new\" drug because many of its features are different, and its activity spectrum may be broader. ',\n",

Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium. The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2) for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586 +/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens, the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and 588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression. In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic epithelium. \",\n",

The authors used the Sarns centrifugal pump (Sarns 3M, Ann Arbor, MI) as a ventricular assist device (VAD) in 30 patients between May 1985 and February 1990. Sixteen patients were unweanable from cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of surgery; nine were patients who developed cardiogenic shock postoperatively in the intensive care unit. One was a donor organ failure; one had a failed PTCA; and one an acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock preoperatively. Two patients were bridged to cardiac transplantation. Of the 28 nontransplant candidates, 20 (71.4%) were weaned successfully, 14 (50%) were discharged from the hospital, and 13 (46%) are alive from 1 to 46 months postoperatively (mean, 21.1 months). Three patients received right ventricular support alone; all three were weaned, and two (66.7%) were discharged. Ten patients received left ventricular assistance alone. Six (60%) were weaned, and four (40%) were discharged. Two patients received left ventricular support initially but were taken back for right VAD insertion because of right-sided heart failure; one (50%) is alive. Fifteen patients received biventricular support. Eleven (77.3%) were weaned, and eight (53.3%) were discharged. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 73 years, with a mean age for men of 59 years and 50.5 years for women. There were no thromboembolic events. Various clinical parameters were evaluated to determine effect on weanability and survival. These results show survival equivalent to any other VAD at this time.

A prospective randomized study was performed in 46 consecutive patients with refractory congestive heart failure (CHF) due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to compare the hemodynamic responses to 48-hour infusions of amrinone and dobutamine. Both drugs substantially reduced pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, right atrial pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac index. Amrinone caused a greater decrease in right atrial pressure than dobutamine (p less than 0.02) and had a positive chronotropic effect not observed with dobutamine (p less than 0.01). The increase in heart rate produced by amrinone correlated inversely with the changes in right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures, suggesting a baroreceptor response to reduced preload. Dobutamine produced a larger increase in stroke volume index than amrinone (p less than 0.01). Ninety-one percent of patients receiving amrinone and only 65% receiving dobutamine had reduction of greater than or equal to 30% in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (p less than 0.05).

The cellular events during the initiation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation (VF) are poorly understood. We developed a nonischemic, isolated, perfused rabbit Langendorff preparation in which sustained VF could be induced by alternating current (AC) and which allowed changes in perfusate composition. We also used Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition (10 microM ouabain or K(+)-free perfusate) to induce VF. AC stimulation or Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition always initiated VF. Calcium channel blockade by verapamil or nitrendipine uniformly inhibited the initiation of VF in both models. During Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition, 1) VF was prevented by calcium channel blockade, despite evidence of Ca2+ overload, and 2) abolition of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum-generated cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations by ryanodine or Na+ channel blockade with tetrodotoxin did not prevent VF initiation. Lowering extracellular [Ca2+] to 80 microM uniformly prevented the initiation of VF due to Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition but not that due to AC stimulation. VF maintenance also was studied using 1) reduction in perfusate [Ca2+], 2) blockade of Ca2+ channels, or 3) electrical defibrillation. Decreasing the perfusate [Ca2+] to 80 microM resulted in defibrillation during VF whether induced by AC or Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition. Verapamil or nitrendipine also resulted in defibrillation regardless of the initiation method. Electrical defibrillation was successful only in AC-induced VF. The results demonstrate that VF can be initiated and maintained in a nonischemic rabbit Langendorff preparation. The data suggest that increases in slow channel Ca2+ flux, as opposed to increases in cytosolic Ca2+ per se, were necessary for the initiation and maintenance of VF. The data, however, do not exclude an important role for cytosolic Ca2+ in the modulation of VF. ',\n",

Simultaneously with RHC, transmitral flow velocity profiles were obtained by tpDE, and the ratio of the velocity-time integrals of late diastolic active (A wave) and early diastolic passive inflow into the left ventricle (E wave) was calculated (A/E ratio). Invasively determined pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) ranged from 3 to 36 mm Hg (median 13.35, 5%/95% 6/31 mm Hg). Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the A/E ratio and WP (r = .98, p less than .001, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 0.10). The A/E ratio also correlated with other hemodynamic variables such as cardiac output (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.33), cardiac index (r = -.74, p less than .001, SEE = 0.31), and stroke volume index (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.34).

Although long-term transfusion therapy is at least 90% effective in preventing recurrent strokes after an initial cerebrovascular accident in patients with sickle cell disease, it is unknown how long transfusion therapy should be continued. To address this question, we prospectively discontinued transfusions in 10 patients with sickle cell disease whose median duration of transfusion therapy after an initial stroke was 9 1/2 years (range 5 to 12 years). Before the transfusions were discontinued, patients were examined by cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, neuropsychologic testing, electroencephalography, and a complete neurologic examination. Within 12 months after transfusion therapy was stopped, 5 of 10 patients had had an ischemic event. Three events caused relatively mild deficits in the same areas as those originally affected. Two were associated with massive intracranial hemorrhage, including one on the contralateral side of original involvement. An additional patient died suddenly of unknown causes. Of the four remaining patients, three declined to resume transfusion and are relatively well at greater than or equal to 18 months after therapy was stopped. The studies performed before transfusions were stopped were not predictive of recurrent stroke. The risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accident in this group was significantly greater than the estimated risk of 10% in patients who are receiving long-term transfusion therapy (p = 0.002). This adverse outcome suggests that patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke must receive long-term transfusion indefinitely or a suitable therapeutic alternative must be devised.

Among 31 patients with NHDL, there was agreement between MRI and CT findings in 21 patients; MRI findings were positive and CT findings were negative in 8 patients; and MRI findings were negative and CT findings were positive in 2 patients. The false-negative findings of MRI included a laparotomy-proven mesenteric mass and a 6.6-cm lesion in the spleen, both shown by CT. In 13 evaluable patients with HD, there was agreement between MRI and laparotomy findings in 8 patients; MRI findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in 4 patients; and MRI findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in 1 patient. CT findings agreed with laparotomy findings in nine patients; CT findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in one patient: and CT findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in three patients. This suggested that MRI, although more sensitive than CT, was less specific with more false-positive findings. The spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) for the spleen was generally higher in patients with HD who had pathologically confirmed splenic involvement, and tended to increase with increasing spleen weight. This study was performed on a prototype 0.15 Tesla (Technicare Inc., Solon, OH) resistive unit at a time when methods and reporting for MRI were still being developed.

To determine the proper management of splenic infarcts and abscess due to septic emboli, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 108 patients with left-sided endocarditis who underwent valvular surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital from 1980 through 1988. Intravenous drug abuse was the etiology in 68% (n = 73). The incidence of splenic infarcts and abscess was 19% (n = 20), but an incidental finding of splenic infarcts was found in 38% (n = 11) of 29 asymptomatic patients who had computed tomograms. Streptococci and staphylococci were the causative organisms in 85% (n = 17). Localized findings were absent in 90% of splenic infarcts and abscesses. Abdominal computed tomograms were diagnostic of the sequelae of splenic septic emboli in 100%. No patient had intra-abdominal bleeding complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Splenectomy was performed in 50% (n = 10) of patients 3-24 days (mean, 11.2 days) after valve replacement. Indications for splenectomy included persistent sepsis in 60% (n = 6), large (greater than 2 cm) and peripheral lesions in 30% (n = 3), and splenic rupture in 10% (n = 1). Perioperative mortality of patients who underwent splenectomy was 30% (n = 3). The following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Splenic septic embolus is common in endocarditis. 2) Abdominal computed tomography should be performed for all patients. ',\n",

Although reported in the aerospace literature and anecdotally by anesthesiologists, the putative antiemetic effect of ephedrine remains unquantitated. We therefore prospectively studied ephedrine as an antiemetic agent in the perioperative setting in 97 patients undergoing general anesthesia for outpatient gynecologic laparoscopy. Patients were assigned in a double-blind randomized fashion to receive a standardized general anesthetic followed by an intramuscular dose of either ephedrine (0.5 mg/kg), droperidol (0.04 mg/kg), or saline before the conclusion of surgery. Nausea, retching, or vomiting, as well as the degree of sedation and discharge times, were assessed in the recovery room and for 24 h postoperatively. Ephedrine was found to have a significantly antiemetic effect (P less than 0.05) when compared with placebo and an antiemetic effect similar to that of droperidol. Sedation scores were also significantly less in the ephedrine group than in both placebo and droperidol groups. Finally, variations in mean arterial blood pressure among the three groups were not statistically significant. We conclude that ephedrine is an effective antiemetic agent with minimal sedative side effects in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopy. ',\n",

We prospectively studied the prognostic significance of conjugate eye deviation in 80 patients with acute stroke and compared the 3-month mortality and disability of these patients to those of the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke. Mortality of patients with conjugate eye deviation was higher (41%) than for the general stroke population (34%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p less than 0.179). Looking at mortality and disability together, we found the outcome of patients with conjugate eye deviation to be significantly worse (p less than 0.001). Deviation of the eyes occurred more frequently to the right (65%) than to the left (35%). In the patient group with eye deviation to the left, mortality was significantly higher (64%, p less than 0.001) than in the group with eye deviation to the right (25%); only two patients of the former group (n = 28) could return home. Compared to the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke, the group with eye deviation to the left did significantly worse, both for mortality alone (p less than 0.001) and for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.001). The group with eye deviation to the right did significantly worse only for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.01). Our results indicate that conjugate eye deviation is a prognostic factor for poor short-term mortality and disability in stroke patients, especially when the eyes are deviated to the left. ',\n",

The administration of the aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) to rats causes the nephrotic syndrome that is associated with an acute decline in renal function, and an interstitial infiltrate. We examined whether essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), which inhibits macrophage infiltration in glomerulonephritis, affects PAN-induced renal dysfunction. Both control and EFAD rats developed proteinuria that resolved over 28 d. After PAN administration, there was a prominent infiltration of macrophages in rats fed a normal diet. The infiltrate was prevented by the EFAD diet. The absence of a macrophage interstitial infiltrate was associated with a significantly higher Cin in the EFAD rats than in controls at 7 d (5.21 +/- 1.19 versus 0.39 +/- 0.08, P less than 0.002 ml/min/kg BW). In addition, CPAH fell to less than 10 ml/min/kg BW by day 7 in controls, but remained the same as normal in the EFAD. After administration of PAN to control rats, there was no increase in urinary thromboxane excretion or an increase in glomerular thromboxane production. Furthermore, the effect of EFAD could not be mimicked by the administration of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Irradiation-induced leukopenia in rats on a normal diet markedly improved glomerular filtration and renal blood flow in acutely nephrotic rats. EFAD prevents the interstitial cellular infiltrate and the renal ischemia associated with experimental nephrosis. The recruitment of mononuclear cells into the kidney following PAN directly contributes to the decline in renal function. ',\n",

They were no significant gender or racial differences in age at diagnosis. There was no significant gender difference in overall incidence. Although incidence rates were slightly higher in blacks compared with whites, the difference was not significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Females (median, 74 months) survived longer than males (median, 29 months), although this difference weakened after controlling for stage. No racial differences in survival were observed. White females survived the longest (median, 94 months), followed by black females (median, 41 months), black males (median, 34 months), and white males (median, 29 months).

The authors performed 25 fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation procedures in nine patients with rectal strictures. In all cases, the stricture developed after rectal surgery. Four patients underwent ileoanal anastomosis after total colectomy for various conditions; five patients underwent rectosigmoid end-to-end anastomosis after resection of a tumor or as treatment for diverticulitis. Maximal stricture dilatation was attained in 20 instances with a single 15-30-mm balloon. In five procedures, two balloons (20 or 15 mm) were inflated simultaneously (\"kissing balloons\" technique) to dilate the strictures. In five patients, only one dilation procedure was required for effective treatment of the strictures, with no clinical evidence of strictures after follow-up of 1.5-56 months (mean, 29.5 months). In the other four patients, multiple procedures were performed: nine in one patient, five in one patient, and three in two patients. In these patients, no recurrent symptoms developed during follow-up of 1.25-18 months (mean, 8.1 months) after the last dilation. Complicating leaks, infection, or hemorrhage did not occur after any of the procedures. Fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of rectal strictures. ',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To compare a simplified method of measuring extravascular lung water (EVLW) using only a single indicator (EVLW-SI) with the standard double indicator dilution technique (EVLW-DI). DESIGN: Direct comparison of EVLW-SI with EVLW-DI in 18 critically ill patients. SETTING: A general medical ICU in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine men and nine women, ages 19 to 80 yr. Six patients were in shock (four from septic shock), and 11 were in respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: EVLW-DI and cardiac output were measured in triplicate during injection of cold indocyanine green dye. Cardiac output was calculated both from pulmonary artery (COpa) and femoral artery (COfem-di) thermal dilution signals. EVLW-SI and COfem-si were also measured during three additional injections of cold saline using only thermal signals from the pulmonary and femoral arteries. Order of measurements was random. EVLW-SI was measured in ten patients while blood was withdrawn through the femoral catheter and in ten patients without blood drawn through the femoral catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 84 comparisons were made. Although the overall correlations were good (r2 = .86), EVLW-SI systematically overestimated EVLW-DI (p less than .05). This difference was greater when EVLW-SI was measured without blood withdrawal through the femoral catheter. In this subgroup, mean values for EVLW by the two methods were within 20% of one another in only two of ten patients, in contrast to the results in six of eight patients in which blood was withdrawn through the catheter. COfem-si and COfem-di also overestimated COpa. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, neither injection of green dye nor blood withdrawal should be necessary during measurements of EVLW-SI, making it a simpler technique for bedside use than EVLW-DI. However, significant discrepancies exist between the two techniques. Some of this difference is apparently due to technical factors related to catheter design. In any case, we cannot recommend use of the single indicator dilution technique at present to estimate EVLW. ',\n",
       " 508: \"Evaluation of endosonography in TN staging of oesophageal cancer. Strategies for the treatment of cancer of the oesophagus depend on the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis. Resection, the only curative treatment, is confined to early tumour stages. Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment. Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly. Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours. In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement. Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study. The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference. For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test). This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus. \",\n",

Steady-state plasma antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations were measured at intervals throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period in 105 women who underwent 134 pregnancies. Phenytoin (PHT) dosage had to be increased in 85% of pregnancies in which the drug was received, carbamazepine (CBZ) dosage in 70%, and phenobarbital (PB) or methylphenobarbital (MPB) dosage in 85%, in an attempt to prevent or correct a fall in plasma concentrations of the respective drugs as pregnancy progressed. The altered disposition of the AEDs usually began in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy (often before epileptic pregnant women are referred for neurological supervision), and had returned to baseline value within 4 weeks of childbirth in two thirds of the women receiving PHT. The return to the nonpregnant situation appeared to be slower for CBZ, PB, and MPB. In women studied during more than one pregnancy, the changes in AED dosage to plasma concentration ratios tended to be greater in the first than in the subsequent pregnancies. Full seizure control prior to pregnancy was associated with a more favorable outcome for freedom from seizures during pregnancy. However, the plasma level monitoring-dosage adjustment policy produced no marked improvement in overall seizure control in pregnancy. This may have occurred because some patients were seen too late in their pregnancies for the policy to have been applied optimally. ',\n",

The diagnosis was based on clinical and genealogical data, was confirmed in 3 patients at autopsy and in 2 others by biopsy. Focal neurological signs, and at least some degree of global cognitive deterioration, were observed in all patients, with unequivocal dementia in 4. MRI showed haemorrhages and areas of gliosis and, to a variable extent, hyperintensity of the white matter in T2-weighted images. Neuropathological examination revealed a large recent haemorrhage together with residual lesions from previous haemorrhages or infarcts in all patients examined. The white matter lesions, present on MRI, turned out to be areas of 'incomplete infarction' with demyelination. It is concluded that (hereditary) amyloid angiopathy can lead to strokes, but also to subcortical ischaemic encephalopathy. Amyloid angiopathy should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of white matter lesions, found on CT or MRI, especially when patients present with a cerebral haemorrhage. The relationship between HCHWA-D and Alzheimer's disease, another disease with cerebral amyloid deposition and diffuse white matter involvement, is discussed. \",\n",

Establishing a diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease can be difficult because Kayser-Fleischer rings may not be present and parameters of copper metabolism, including serum and urinary copper, and serum ceruloplasmin levels are neither specific nor diagnostic. In this study, ratios of both the serum alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase were constructed to evaluate their usefulness in differentiating fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease (n = 6) from other etiologies (n = 43). An analysis of the data showed that cutoff values of less than 2.0 for the alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio and greater than 4.0 for the aspartate transaminase ratio were associated with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease only (P less than 0.001).

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This study compared canine systemic hemodynamics and organ blood flow (radioactive microsphere technique) after resuscitation with 0.8% saline (Na+ 137 mEq/L), 7.2% hypertonic saline (Na+ 1233 mEq/L), 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.8% saline, or 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 7.2% saline, each in a volume approximating 15% of shed blood volume. Twenty-four endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18 to 24 kg) underwent a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock, from time 0 to 30 min into the shock period, followed by fluid resuscitation. Data were collected at baseline, 15 min into the shock period, immediately after fluid infusion, 5 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and at 60-min intervals for 2 hr, (65 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and 125 min after the beginning of resuscitation). The animals received one of four randomly assigned iv resuscitation fluids: saline (54 mL/kg), hypertonic saline (6.0 mL/kg), hydroxyethel starch (6.0 mL/kg) or hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (6.0 mL/kg). RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure increased in all groups after resuscitation. Cardiac output increased with resuscitation in all groups, exceeding baseline in the saline and hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch groups (p less than .05 compared with hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch). Sixty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, cardiac output was significantly (p less than .05) greater in either of the two colloid-containing groups than in the hypertonic saline group. After resuscitation, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch produced minimal improvements in hepatic arterial flow, hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch increased hepatic arterial flow to near baseline levels, and saline markedly increased hepatic arterial flow to levels exceeding baseline (p less than .05, saline vs. hydroxyethyl starch). One hundred twenty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, hepatic arterial flow had decreased in all groups; hepatic arterial flow in the hypertonic saline group had decreased to levels comparable with those during shock. Myocardial, renal, and brain blood flow were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Small-volume resuscitation with the combination of hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch is comparable with much larger volumes of 0.8% saline, and is equal to hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch in the ability to restore and sustain BP and improve organ blood flow after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock.

Dynamic exercise increases the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in mixed lymphocytes by a mechanism that is incompletely understood. In a set of in vivo studies, we have investigated the effects of dynamic exercise on the subset distribution of circulating lymphocytes and on the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in each of these subsets in two groups of patients. In healthy subjects, exercise increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and caused lymphocytosis. Whereas the number of Thelper cells increased only modestly, the number of Tsuppressor/cytotoxic and natural killer cells more than tripled. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors varied among subsets but was not significantly altered by dynamic exercise in any subset except natural killer cells (35% increase, p = 0.0302). In a group of patients with congestive heart failure, dynamic exercise increased plasma norepinephrine but did not alter plasma epinephrine and did not cause significant lymphocytosis. We did not detect any significant alterations of circulating leukocyte subsets or beta-adrenergic receptors in any of these subsets after exercise. A combined analysis of healthy patients and heart failure patients revealed a significant correlation between increases in plasma epinephrine and increases in circulating lymphocytes. We conclude that the exercise-induced increase in beta-adrenergic receptors of mixed lymphocytes is predominantly caused by a redistribution of circulating cell subsets that differ in their beta-adrenergic receptor number. This appears to be mediated by epinephrine rather than norepinephrine. ',\n",

We studied 22 consecutive patients referred to an esophageal diagnostic center for evaluation of noncardiac chest pain or dysphagia having high amplitude esophageal contractions, 14 of whom completed the study. Diltiazem (60-90 mg qid) was compared with placebo, each being administered for 8 wk. Patients were evaluated with esophageal motility pre- and posttreatment periods and with regular symptom assessment throughout each 8-wk treatment. Active diltiazem therapy resulted in significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean distal esophageal peristaltic pressure (128 +/- 20 mm Hg; +/- SE) than placebo (158 +/- 16 mm Hg). Mean chest pains scores were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower with diltiazem therapy than with placebo. Only nine of the 14 patients fulfilled presently acceptable criteria for diagnosing nutcracker esophagus, and the diltiazem effect was similar, although not significant, because of the smaller sample. Conclusions: In this preliminary study involving 14 patients, the oral calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, appeared to improve noncardiac chest pain associated with strong esophageal contraction, the nutcracker esophagus. These improved symptoms were associated with significant decreases in contraction pressure. ',\n",

The rate of O2 consumption, 2.6 l/min (1.8-3.3) (average from cool and hot conditions), corresponded to 55-77% of their individual maximums. In the cool environment a steady state was reached at 30 min. When the subjects were shifted to the hot room, the core temperature and heart rate started to rise and reached values greater than 39 degrees C and near-maximal values, respectively, at the termination of the exercise. The leg blood flow (thermodilution method), femoral arteriovenous O2 difference, and consequently leg O2 consumption were unchanged in the hot compared with the cool condition. There was no increase in release of lactate and no reduction in glucose and free net fatty acid uptake in the exercising leg in the heat. Furthermore, the rate of glycogen utilization in the gastrocnemius muscle was not elevated in the hot environment. There was a tendency for cardiac output to increase in the heat (mean 15.2 to 18.4 l/min), which may have contributed to the increase in skin circulation, together with a possible further reduction in flow to other vascular beds, because muscle blood flow was not reduced.

To determine the role of chronic ethanol intoxication on the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an ethanol-containing diet for 1 week before intratracheal challenge with type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae and for 10 days after infection. Control rats were fed the same diet except that ethanol was replaced isocalorically with carbohydrate. Ethanol treatment increased pneumococcal bacteremia, levels of capsular polysaccharide antigenemia, and susceptibility to lethal pneumonia. Once dissemination occurred, ethanol-fed rats failed to eliminate pneumococci from the bloodstream. Ethanol-fed rats demonstrated a defect in late pulmonary clearance of pneumococci that was temporally associated with a significantly higher pneumonia severity index. Pneumonia was characterized by an intense polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, severe edema, and a fibrous exudate. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the heightened inflammatory response in the lungs of ethanol-fed rats, suggesting that chronic ethanol intoxication did not impair polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment but may alter their antipneumococcal functions.

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of the results of a health check up in a group of clinically healthy middle aged men in the late 1960s (median year 1968). The subjects were invited to enter into a primary prevention trial for cardiovascular disease in 1974, when they underwent clinical examination for risk factors. The trial was completed in 1979, when the men were re-examined. Follow up was in 1986. SETTING--Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland and second department of medicine, University of Helsinki. SUBJECTS--In all, 3490 men born during 1919-34 participated in a health check up in the late 1960s. In 1974, 1815 of these men who were clinically healthy were entered into a primary prevention trial for cardiovascular disease. On clinical examination 1222 of the men were considered at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Of these, 612 received an intervention and were excluded from the study. A total of 593 men were without risk factors. The study comprised all of the men who did not have an intervention (n = 1203). In 1979, 1120 men were re-examined, and in 1986 945 men attended follow up. There were two groups for analysis: one comprising all subjects and the other comprising only men who were normotensive in 1968 and for whom complete information was available. INTERVENTIONS--By 1979, 103 men were taking antihypertensive drugs, and by 1986, 131 were taking antihypertensive drugs and 12 were taking drugs for hyperglycaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load, blood pressure, and body weight were measured in 1968, 1974, and 1979. In 1986 blood pressure and body weight were recorded. RESULTS--Men who were hypertensive in 1986 had significantly higher blood pressures (p less than 0.0001) and (after adjustment for body mass index and alcohol intake) significantly higher blood glucose concentrations one hour after a glucose load at all examinations than those who were normotensive in 1986. Regression analysis showed that the higher the blood glucose concentration after a glucose load in 1968 the higher the blood pressure during the following years. Those men between the second and third tertiles of blood glucose concentration in 1968 had a significantly higher risk of developing hypertension (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.77) compared with those below the first tertile. CONCLUSION--In this study men who developed hypertension tended to have shown an increased intolerance to glucose up to 18 years before the clinical manifestation of their disorder. Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load was an independent predictor of future hypertension. ',\n",

Radical prostatectomy was performed in 14 patients following local failure of radiation therapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Ten patients were treated with external beam and 4 with interstitial radiation. The interval from beginning radiation therapy to biopsy-proved residual or recurrent disease was twenty-four to one hundred fourteen months (mean 61 months). Ten patients had significant anterior and lateral fibrosis. Five patients had loss of tissue planes between the prostate and rectum, however, no rectal injuries occurred. Estimated blood loss was 300-8,000 cc (median 1,000 cc). Operative time was one hundred ten to three hundred seventy-five minutes (median 185 minutes). Significant late complications are impotence (100%) and incontinence (55%). Tumor volume was 1.1-27.2 cc (mean 11.1 cc). Seven patients had seminal vesicle involvement, 9 had level III capsule penetration, and 6 had positive surgical margins. Follow-up ranges from one to fifty-two months (median 18 months). Currently, 6 patients are clinically without disease and have serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 0.0 ng/mL. Four patients have no clinical evidence of disease but do have detectable serum PSA, and 4 patients have evidence of metastatic bone disease on bone scan with elevated serum PSA levels. Radical prostatectomy following radiation therapy has no greater immediate morbidity or mortality compared with radical prostatectomy without prior irradiation and takes only slightly longer to perform. However, there is a marked increased risk of impotence and incontinence. More patients followed for a longer time are needed to assess the benefit of radical prostatectomy on survival of patients who fail radiation therapy. ',\n",

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To define the time course of myocardial ischemic injury using high-energy phosphate (HEP) depletion and the cessation of lactate production as metabolic markers. SETTING: Data were collected in a laboratory animal model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Ten immature mixed breed swine weighing 23.2 +/- 3.5 kg. DESIGN: After thoracotomy, transmural myocardial biopsies were taken in vivo during normal sinus rhythm and at designated times during ventricular fibrillation with total circulatory arrest (VF-TCA). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Frozen tissue samples were analyzed for adenine nucleotides, by high-performance liquid chromatography, and lactate by enzymatic assay. At five minutes of VF-TCA, myocardial adenosine triphosphate averaged 50% of control. At 15 minutes of VF-TCA, 89% of animals had myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels above 20% of control and adenylate charge ratio above 0.60. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, all animals had adenosine triphosphate levels below 10% of control and adenylate charge ratio below 0.30. In addition, myocardial lactate levels plateaued after 30 minutes of VF-TCA, indicating the cessation of lactate production. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the myocardium can tolerate VF-TCA for as long as 15 minutes without irreversible injury; however, post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction may occur after as little as five minutes of VF-TCA. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, myocardial injury is likely to be irreversible. ',\n",

In a 3-year prospective study of 643 consecutive laparoscopies for infertility, pelvic pain, or infertility and pain, the pelvic area, the depth of infiltration, and the volume of endometriotic lesions were evaluated. The incidence, area, and volume of subtle lesions decreased with age, whereas for typical lesions these parameters and the depth of infiltration increased with age. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis was strongly associated with pelvic pain, women with pain having larger and deeper lesions. Because deep endometriosis has little emphasis in the revised American Fertility Society classification and after analyzing the diagnoses made in each class, considerations for a simplifying revision with inclusion of deep lesions are suggested. In conclusion, suggestive evidence is presented to support the concept that endometriosis is a progressive disorder, and it is demonstrated that deep endometriosis is strongly associated with pelvic pain.

Clinical correlations were performed on subgroups of 149 patients with low-grade lymphoma (LG) and 205 patients with diffuse lymphoma with a large cell component (DLLC). Correlations were made between clinical outcome and individual recurring cytogenetic aberrations, each of which was noted in greater than 5% of cases belonging to LG NHL and DLLC, and derived measures of karyotypic complexity, comprising modal chromosome number, number of marker chromosomes, and number of translocation breakpoints. No correlations with survival were noted in LG NHL, although median follow-up was only 2 years. Seven patients with t(8;14) LG NHL had an indolent course. Among 104 patients with DLLC and abnormal karyotypes at diagnosis, breaks at 1q21-23 or more than 4 marker chromosomes was associated with a shortened median survival. Using these variables we constructed a proportional hazards model with a good fit to observed data. Breaks at 6q21-25 predicted a decreased probability of achieving remission. Patients with DLLC and breaks at 1q21-23 or 1p32-36 had a shorter duration of complete remission. Of 41 DLLC studied at relapse, the only long-term survivors had t(14;18). \",\n",

DESIGN: Data on patients having colonoscopy collected prospectively according to a set protocol. The size and location of all polyps were noted, and all polyps were biopsied. SETTING: Two university hospitals. PATIENTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between 31 December 1987 and 31 August 1989. RESULTS: Of the 970 patients who met eligibility requirements, 274 (28.3%) had adenomas and 108 (11.1%) had hyperplastic polyps. The proportion of patients with distal hyperplastic polyps and proximal adenomas (31.9%) was similar to the proportion of those without distal hyperplastic polyps (23.0%) (crude odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.77 to 3.06). After adjusting for age and sex, the results were unchanged (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; CI, 0.82 to 2.88). Patients with distal adenomas, on the other hand, were three times more likely to have proximal adenomas than those without distal adenomas (adjusted odds ratio, 3.42; CI, 1.99 to 5.88). CONCLUSIONS: Distal hyperplastic polyps are not strong predictors of risk for proximal adenomas. Based on the magnitude of the risk difference, we do not believe that finding a hyperplastic polyp during sigmoidoscopy justifies doing a full colonoscopy to search for proximal adenomas. Because rectosigmoid adenomas are associated with proximal adenomas, however, small polyps seen during sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied to determine their type. Colonoscopy should be reserved for patients who are proved to have adenomas. ',\n",

Cyclic antidepressants may cause changes in the electrocardiogram at therapeutic or toxic serum levels. The most serious complications of cyclic antidepressant toxicity are dysrhythmias, hypotension, and seizures. It is predominantly the cardiotoxic effects that cause mortality. Once cardiotoxicity is evident, the treatment of choice is serum alkalinization, preferably by sodium bicarbonate therapy. In order to predict which overdose patients are at high risk for complications, electrocardiographic criteria have been identified as reliable screens. For \"first generation\" tricyclic antidepressants, QRS prolongation (particularly greater than 100 msec) and a terminal 40-ms frontal plane axis greater than 120 degrees are the most sensitive. This article reviews antidepressant pharmacology, electrocardiographic manifestations of antidepressant cardiotoxicity, and approaches to treatment of antidepressant-induced conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias.

The outcome of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty in this subgroup of patients is unclear. Therefore, 67 patients (group 1) underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty between December 1, 1986 and November 1, 1987 who had a low cardiac index (less than 2.5 liters/min per m2) and a low aortic valve gradient (less than or equal to 40 mm Hg) before the procedure. The results were compared with 200 patients (group 2) who had a low cardiac index but not a low aortic valve gradient (greater than 40 mm Hg) before the procedure and who had similar baseline presenting symptoms.

To see how common relapsing fever is in Senegal thick blood smears from cases of fever of unknown origin and from randomly selected clinic outpatients from a rural dispensary were examined for Borrelia. The prevalence of Borrelia infections in small mammals was also assessed. Borrelia was seen in smears of 12 (0.9%) of 1340 children. All children who tested positive had complained of acute fever. Prevalence was 0% (0/496), 0.5% (2/417), 1.6% (5/308), and 4.2% (5/119) at ages 0-1, 2-4, 5-9, and 10-14, respectively. 26 other instances of borreliosis were seen in patients from different regions of Senegal. Blood samples from 7 of these patients were inoculated intraperitoneally into white mice; serious infection developed in all mice. Borrelia was seen in thick smears from 65 of 461 wild rodents or insectivores. Six rodents species were infected. From a sample of 93 rodents, 33.3% were infected, as judged by intraperitoneal inoculation of white mice, compared with 14.1% by direct smear examination.

Multivisceral isografts and allografts were transplanted to Lewis rats, and the histopathologic changes were studied in the liver, intestine, and other constituent organs. Rats receiving isografts had indefinite survival with maintenance of weight. With multivisceral allografts (from Brown-Norway donors), the intestinal component was rejected more severely than the companion liver and with about the same severity as when intestinal transplantation was performed alone. Intestinal rejection in either circumstance was a lethal event, causing death in 10 to 12 days. The earliest (by day 4) and most intense cellular rejection was in the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. This was associated with or followed by cryptitis, epithelial cell necrosis, focal abscess formation, mural necrosis, and eventual perforation. Liver allografts transplanted alone or as part of multivisceral grafts also had histopathologic evidence of rejection, but this was self-limiting and spontaneously reversible when the liver was transplanted alone. Thus the Achille's heel of multivisceral grafts is the intestinal component that is not protected by the presence of the liver in the organ complex. Better immunosuppression should permit successful experimental and clinical transplantation of such grafts. \",\n",

Infants were categorized by means of the Bohn quadrant analysis to determine the impact of ECMO on infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and a \"poor prognosis.\" All infants assigned to the Bohn 100% mortality quadrant required ECMO. The survival rate in this group was 86% (6/7) when assessed preoperatively and 67% (6/9) when assessed postoperatively. Comparison of the change occurring in ventilation index and arterial carbon dioxide pressure demonstrated that after repair the clinical condition of 48% of infants deteriorated, 40% improved, and 12% remained unchanged. Of the 12 infants whose condition was worse after surgery, 11 eventually required ECMO.

Agreement between the two groups of pathologists was 97% for primary epithelial ovarian cancer and 89% for primary nonepithelial ovarian malignancies. Agreement on diagnosis of major cellular subtypes of ovarian malignancy ranged between 73% for endometrioid cancer and 100% for clear cell carcinomas.

The results of a light and transmission electron microscopic analysis of an endolymphatic sac (ES) from a patient suffering from episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss are presented. A biopsy of the intraosseous portion of the ES was obtained during a translabyrinthine approach to section the vestibular nerve in the internal acoustic meatus. The material consisted mainly of tubular epithelial structures filled with heavily stained material. Pathologically dilated and degranulated rough endoplasmic reticuli and disaggregation of polyribosomes with accumulation of solitary ribosomes in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum suggested a disturbed epithelial cell protein synthesis. Ultrastructural evidence of an increased merocrine secretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES was noted. This made it possible to analyze the presumed intracellular secretory pathways. An increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and monocytes was observed. Since the inner ear had been subjected to surgical intervention before the vestibular nerve section, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether the patient's symptoms were related to the disturbed protein metabolism and hypersecretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES. The findings support earlier experimental results that indicate that the ES has not only a resorptive function but also a secretory one. \",\n",

Diaphragm fatigue, as determined from the decrease in the maximal relaxation rate of twitches, occurred after 20 minutes of bilateral or unilateral nerve stimulation with RPT, but only after 60 min (unilateral stimulation) or 98 min (bilateral stimulation) with MSWT. These data show the importance of the motor signal pattern in long-lasting nerve stimulation. ',\n",
       " 555: 'Predicting recurrence time of esophageal carcinoma through assessment of histologic factors and DNA ploidy. Cytophotometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was done in 128 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The relationship among histopathologic features, DNA distribution pattern, and survival time was investigated from the standpoint of recurrence. Of 128 patients, 77 (60.1%) died of recurrence within 2 years after surgery: 16 (12.5%) from 2 to 5 years and two (1.6%) over 5 years. The rate of death of recurrence within 2 years was higher in patients with T4 or N1 than T1, T2, and T3 or N0 (P less than 0.01). Survivors over 5 years more frequently possessed type II DNA pattern than types III and IV (P less than 0.05). The rate of death of recurrence within 2 years was 34.4% in type II, which was lower than the 59.6% rate in type III (P less than 0.05) and the 76.6% rate in type IV (P less than 0.01). Survivors from 2 to 5 years were higher in type III than in type IV (P less than 0.05), and recurrence over 5 years was found only in type II. This inclination was more apparent in those with curative resection. In the patients with type II, careful follow-up may be needed over 5 years for late recurrence. However, in those with type IV, no recurrence over 2 years could be regarded as healed because most of their recurrences occur within 2 years. These findings suggest that the growth rate of esophageal carcinoma should reflect DNA aneuploidy, and the DNA analysis of esophageal carcinoma should be a valuable parameter for postoperative follow-up planning.

Real-time cranial sonography, intracranial Doppler, and neuromuscular sonography are the sonographic techniques that are applicable to the neurologic evaluation of infants and children. Although limited by age, specificity, and operator skill and experience, the advantages of real-time cranial and intracranial Doppler sonography make them useful techniques in the evaluation of the young infant, particularly in the serial assessment of ventricular size and in the study of the critically ill infant.

To elucidate the effect of blood volume on the circulatory adjustment to heat stress, we studied alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats at three levels of blood volume: normovolemia (NBV), hypervolemia (HBV; +32% plasma volume by isotonic albumin solution infusion), and hypovolemia (LBV; -16% plasma volume by furosemide administration). Body surface heating was performed with an infrared lamp to raise arterial blood temperature (Tb) at the rate of approximately 0.1 degree C/min. Before heating, central venous pressure (CVP) was significantly higher in HBV (0.41 +/- 0.25 mmHg) and lower in LBV (-1.44 +/- 0.22 mmHg) than in NBV (-0.41 +/- 0.10 mmHg). The Tb at which CVP started to decrease was approximately 40 degrees C in HBV, approximately 41 degrees C in NBV, and approximately 42 degrees C in LBV, and it decreased by 1.53 +/- 0.14, 1.92 +/- 0.24, and 0.62 +/- 0.14 mmHg from 37 to 43 degrees C of Tb in HBV, NBV, and LBV, respectively. Stroke volume was closely correlated with CVP, and this relationship was not affected by Tb. Heart rate responses to the raised Tb were similar among the three groups. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not affected by blood volume modification or CVP and was maintained at preheating (Tb 37 degrees C) level until Tb rose to 40 degrees C. Above this Tb, MAP increased until Tb reached 43 degrees C (+30-40 mmHg) for all three groups. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) was inversely correlated with CVP, and the slope of the linear relationship between TPR and CVP in LBV was three- to fourfold steeper than in NBV or HBV. ',\n",

One hundred dogs had no treatment before amputation or death. One hundred other dogs were treated with either radiation therapy alone (n = 23), intraarterial (IA) cisplatin alone (n = 16), intravenous (IV) cisplatin alone (n = 6), radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin (n = 47), or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin (n = 8). Eighty-nine of these 100 dogs had their tumors resected 3 weeks after the end of therapy (6 weeks after the initiation of therapy) and replaced with a cortical bone allograft. Dogs with preoperative treatment were evaluated for local tumor control and time to metastasis. The mean percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma was 26.8%. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation only, IA cisplatin only, and IV cisplatin only was 81.6%, 49.1% and 23.8%, respectively. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin was 83.7% and 78.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference between percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma compared with those receiving IV cisplatin, but there was a significant increase in percent tumor necrosis with all other treatments. A mathematic model for the effect of cisplatin and radiation dose was developed using multiple regression analysis. The radiation dose calculated to cause at least 80% tumor necrosis was 42.2 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 47.6 Gy) when radiation was given alone and 28.1 Gy (95% CI, 21.3 to 36.6 Gy) when radiation was combined with IA cisplatin. Areas of viable tumor tended to be most frequent adjacent to the articular cartilage and in the joint capsule. Percent tumor necrosis was strongly predictive for local tumor control; 28 of 32 dogs with greater than 80% tumor necrosis had local control, and only eight of 29 dogs with less than 79% tumor necrosis had local control (P = 0.0047).

We report clinical features, surgical management, recurrences, and follow-up study of 12 patients with simple hepatic cyst, 11 patients with polycystic liver disease, and 19 patients with cystadenoma who were surgically treated over a 25-year period. The median age of patients was 48 years, and 37 women and 5 men were in the series. The most common presenting symptom and physical finding were chronic abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The most commonly associated disease was polycystic kidney disease, which was an associated finding in 5 of the 11 patients with polycystic liver disease (45%). The most valuable diagnostic studies in all groups were computed tomography and ultrasonography. The location of the disease was bilobar in patients with polycystic liver disease, with a right lobe predominance in 18% of patients. The right lobe was also predominant in 83% of patients with simple hepatic cyst and 58% of patients with cystadenoma. Of all solitary cystic lesions in the left lobe, 75% of them were cystadenomas. Of the 66 surgical procedures performed, aspiration was associated with a failure rate of 100%; partial excision, a failure rate of 61%; and total excision and liver resection, a failure rate of 0%. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in three patients and was associated with two early deaths. Partial excision relieved symptoms in three patients (43%) with polycystic liver disease. Total excision, enucleation, or liver resection with cyst(s) is the treatment of choice for non-parasitic cystic lesions of the liver. ',\n",

On day 9 of infection, the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125 +/- 19 mg in the control group versus 102 +/- 14 mg in the captopril group (p less than 0.0003). Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5% (2.0% to 7.5%) in the placebo group versus 2.0% (0.0% to 5.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The amount of dystrophic calcification was 5.0% (0.0% to 27.5%) in the placebo group versus 1.3% (0.0% to 20.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The extent of the histopathologic involvement by planimetry was 10.2% in the placebo group versus 5.4% in the captopril group (p = 0.052).

The lipid profiles of the 53 patients suffering lacunar infarction were similar on both occasions, the only significant differences being higher total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. No significant changes were observed among the 35 patients suffering cerebral hemorrhage apart from a significantly higher concentration of high density lipoprotein3-cholesterol less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. Our study, with many patients classified according to stroke subtype, gives results different from those of previous studies with much fewer patients. We conclude that in studies of serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations as risk factors for cerebral infarction, comparing values obtained less than or equal to 48 hours after admission with control values may incorrectly identify certain lipid fractions as risk factors.

The neuropsychological abnormalities found in 9 patients with tumours involving the splenium of the corpus callosum are described. The outstanding features of their cognitive deficits were a severe memory deficit and visual perception impairment in the presence of relatively intact intellect. It is argued that (1) the amnesia is due to damage to the fornix where that structure is closely applied to the splenium and that it is the result of a disconnection between the frontal and temporal lobes, although the possibility that damage to more than one structure, for example, retrosplenial cortex and fornix, cannot be excluded; (2) there is a dual pathway for visual object recognition, one of which passes directly to the dominant hemisphere for semantic analysis and the other via the nondominant hemisphere for prior perceptual analysis. Further, it is postulated that there is a subcortical as well as a callosal route between the hemispheres that is important for visual object recognition. ',\n",

Vagotomy, pyloroplasty and underrunning of the bleeding point was performed in 101 cases with ten deaths (10 per cent), partial (Billroth II) gastrectomy in 81 cases with ten deaths (12 per cent), and vagotomy and antrectomy in 16 cases with one death (6 per cent). A patient was more likely to be treated by partial gastrectomy if a giant ulcer with an internal diameter of greater than or equal to 2 cm was found. The results suggest that while vagotomy and pyloroplasty, combined with a direct attack on the bleeding point or excision of an anterior ulcer is an acceptable standard emergency operation for bleeding duodenal ulcer, gastric resection proved to be a satisfactory alternative procedure and should be considered in the technically difficult case with a very large ulcer. A giant ulcer was present in 37 per cent of cases coming to surgery. ',\n",

IgA nephropathy, the most commonly occurring type of chronic glomerulonephritis in individuals of European and Asian descent, exhibits marked heterogeneity of clinical signs and ultimate prognosis. Based upon their studies of regional clustering of the ancestors of related patients in eastern Kentucky, the authors have postulated the existence of an inherited disease susceptibility for IgA nephropathy. They examined serum concentrations of individual complement proteins and phenotypes for C3, C4A, C4B, and factor B (Bf) for related and unrelated patients with IgA nephropathy from Kentucky and for patients from the Mid-South region of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. In these populations, they have described partial complement deficiencies or specific phenotypes which may be associated with the disease. Their findings include the following: (1) partial deficiencies for C2, beta 1H (H), properdin (P), or C4 binding protein (C4BP) in four patients with end-stage renal disease, (2) an association between the C3*F allele with IgA nephropathy in the combined group of unrelated patients from Kentucky and the Mid-South, (3) the occurrence of C4B deficiency in two siblings with IgA nephropathy, and (4) an association between C4A deficiency and poor outcome in patients with IgA nephropathy diagnosed as adults. In addition, the related patients differ from the unrelated patients from Kentucky with respect to frequencies of Bf*F and the BfF (FF + FS + F1F + F1S) phenotype, suggestive of immunogenetic difference between these groups. Important functional differences exist between C4A and C4B isotypes and functional differences are also possible based upon C3 or Bf phenotype. ',\n",

This study investigated the effect of physical training on muscle blood flow (BF) in rats with peripheral arterial insufficiency during treadmill running. Bilateral stenosis of the femoral artery of adult rats (300-350 g) was performed to reduce exercise hyperemia in the hindlimb but not limit resting muscle BF. Rats were divided into normal sedentary, acute stenosed (stenosed 3 days before the experiment), stenosed sedentary (limited to cage activity), and stenosed trained (run on a treadmill by a progressively intense program, up to 50-60 min/day, 5 days/wk for 6-8 wk). Hindlimb BF was determined with 85Sr- and 141Ce-labeled microspheres at a low (20 m/min) and high treadmill speed (30-40 m/min depending on ability). Maximal hindlimb BF was reduced to approximately 50% normal in the acute stenosed group. Total hindlimb BF (81 +/- 5 ml.min-1.100 g-1) did not change in stenosed sedentary animals with 6-8 wk of cage activity, but a redistribution of BF occurred within the hindlimb. Two factors contributed to a higher BF to the distal limb muscle of the trained animals. A redistribution BF within the hindlimb occurred in stenosed trained animals; distal limb BF increased to approximately 80% (P less than 0.001) of the proximal tissue. In addition, an increase in total hindlimb BF with training indicates that collateral BF has been enhanced (P less than 0.025). The associated increase in oxygen delivery to the relatively ischemic muscle probably contributed to the markedly improved exercise tolerance evident in the trained animals. ',\n",

The types and extent of injury are a function of the force causing the injury. Shearing forces of moderate intensity cause hematoma formation, whereas greater force causes lacerations or even amputation. Sharp objects cause lacerations determined by the force, direction, and point of impact. The high ratio of surface area to mass makes the auricle vulnerable to extremes of temperature. People participating in high-risk activities should wear protective headgear. The goal of treatment is to restore the normal contours while preventing infection. Hematoma results in disfigurement by organization or chondritis. Evacuation and pressure dressings using sterile technique correct the condition. Second-degree burns are treated by regular cleansing and application of topical antimicrobials. Deeper burns require debridement, biologic dressings, or burying the cartilage subcutaneously for later reconstruction. Simple lacerations are closed under aseptic technique using either skin-to-skin sutures only or sutures of the skin combined with intercartilage sutures. Extensive and complex lacerations require meticulous care to match all fragments and prevent infection or loss of tissue. Bare cartilage must be covered with vascularized tissue. The treatment of total amputation is controversial. Some advocate reattachment as a composite graft using intravenous low molecular weight dextrans and heparin as adjuvants. Mladick dermabrades the amputated pinna, reattaches it with sutures, and then slips it into a pocket of elevated postauricular skin for 2 weeks. Others urge microvascular reanastomosis of the small nutrient vessels. Brent and Byrd separate the cartilage from its overlying skin and envelope it first with vascularized temporoparietal fascia and then a split-thickness skin graft. Chondritis is the most feared complication of injury or surgery of the pinna. It is an aggressive process, and prompt removal of pus and necrotic cartilage is required. Exteriorization and removal of all cartilage is effective but disfiguring. Removal of only affected cartilage and constant irrigation with antibiotic solutions is effective but requires prolonged hospitalization. Iontophoresis of antibiotics into the auricle may be effective and conserve tissue. Traumatic deformities are corrected with composite grafts from the opposite ear, costal cartilage, and local pedicled flaps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). ',\n",

Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules. Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect. \",\n",

The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of xamoterol in the human myocardium. In the presence of forskolin or milrinone, xamoterol increased isometric force of contraction, contraction velocity, and relaxation velocity in isolated, electrically driven preparations from human myocardium, but had no effect alone. There was no difference in the effect of xamoterol between right atrial myocardium and left ventricular myocardium from nonfailing (NF), moderately failing (NYHA II-III), and severely failing (NYHA IV) human hearts. The positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of isoprenaline were reduced depending on the severity of heart failure in left ventricular myocardium (i.e., NF greater than NYHA II-III greater than NYHA IV). In the presence of norepinephrine, xamoterol produced negative inotropic effects similar to those of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists pindolol and propranolol. Xamoterol alone had no effects on force of contraction, whereas pindolol and propranolol markedly reduced contractile force. In NYHA class IV, isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase about twofold but xamoterol, like pindolol or propranolol, had no effect. Experiments with the beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists CGP 207.12A and ICI 118.551, respectively, showed that the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of xamoterol were mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. Consistently, xamoterol had a selectivity of 13.8 at beta 1-adrenoceptors as measured in radioligand binding experiments. It is concluded that xamoterol acts as a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a selectivity of 13.8 in human ventricular myocardium. The compound has an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as it produces beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the presence of forskolin. The beneficial effects of xamoterol in patients with heart failure could be due to prevention of the detrimental effects of norepinephrine such as beta 1-adrenoceptor downregulation of an increase of Gi (inhibitory guanine-nucleotide binding protein).

To validate the geographic pattern shown by the Medicare data, hospitalization was compared with mortality from inflammatory bowel disease among different states. Mortality and hospitalization statistics both suggested that the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease was determined by environmental factors that had a marked geographic variation within the United States. Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in northern parts of the United States than in southern and in urban more than rural parts. These trends were observed for men and women and for blacks and whites alike. Similar geographic patterns of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis suggested the influence of one or more identical risk factors for both diseases. \",\n",

The tumor was initially resected, but progression was seen at 1-month follow-up. Because further surgery to completely eradicate the tumor would have been extensive and disfiguring, 40-Gy external beam radiation was given in 20 fractions using a three-field wedge technique.

Results of one third of the GH tests were defined as normal (GH peak response, greater than 15 mU/L) within the first 5 years, in comparison with 16% after 5 years. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that dose (p = 0.007) and time from irradiation (p = 0.03), but not age at therapy, had a significant influence on peak GH responses. The late incidence of GH deficiency was similar over the whole dose range (4 of 26 GH test results normal for less than 30 Gy and 4 of 25 normal for greater than or equal to 30 Gy after 5 years), but the speed of onset over the first years was dependent on dose. We conclude that the requirement for GH replacement therapy and the timing of its introduction will be influenced by the dose of irradiation received by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. ',\n",

In the malignant hypercalcaemia group, carcinoma of lung was the most common (31.8 per cent) and carcinoma of breast was uncommon (3.0 per cent). Secondary deposits in bone were detected in 35 of the 122 solid tumours. In order to identify the mechanism of hypercalcaemia the contributions of renal tubular reabsorption and increased bone resorption to the plasma calcium concentration were calculated. Increased tubular reabsorption was the main contributor to hypercalcaemia in primary hyperparathyroidism and carcinoma of liver (none of whom had bony metastases) and it contributed significantly to hypercalcaemia in carcinoma of lung without bony metastases and carcinoma of oesophagus. We conclude that in Hong Kong (a) primary hyperparathyroidism is uncommon, (b) tuberculosis is an important cause and (c) humoral factors may be responsible for a relatively high proportion of cases of malignant hypercalcaemia.

Abnormalities in the fast Fourier transforms of signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained during sinus rhythm appear to distinguish patients with ischemic heart disease and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from those without ventricular tachycardia. This study was performed to determine the power of frequency analysis to detect patients with a history of ventricular fibrillation, to determine the extent to which spectra of signal-averaged ECGs from patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease are comparable and to compare results of signal-averaged ECG analysis in patients with ventricular fibrillation with results of programmed ventricular stimulation. Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with ventricular fibrillation (Group II). Results of signal-averaged ECG analysis were abnormal in 92% of patients with ventricular tachycardia and 85% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS). Abnormal spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90% of patients with ischemic and from 86% of patients with nonischemic heart disease (p = NS). In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly between the two patient groups. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 91% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared with only 46% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.0001). Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81% of patients with ischemic heart disease compared with only 50% of those with nonischemic heart disease (p less than 0.02). Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with ventricular fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose arrhythmia was not inducible by programmed stimulation. These results broaden the potential clinical application of noninvasive interrogation of signal-averaged ECGs to include the prospective identification of patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

To determine whether exposure to chronic hypoxia and subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension induces alterations of endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat pulmonary vascular bed, we studied isolated lung preparations from rats exposed to either room air (controls) or hypoxia (H) during 1 wk (1W-H), 3 wk (3W-H), or 3W-H followed by 48 h recovery to room air (3WH + R). In lungs pretreated with meclofenamate (3 microM), the endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and ionophore A23187 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were examined during conditions of increased tone by U46619 (50 pmol/min). Acetylcholine or A23187 produced dose-dependent vasodilation in control lungs, this response was reduced in group 1W-H (P less than 0.02), abolished in group 3W-H (P less than 0.001), and restored in group 3WH + R. In contrast, the endothelium-independent vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside remained fully active in group 3W-H. The pressor response to 300 pM endothelin was greater in group 3W-H than in controls (6.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) but was not potentiated by the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) antagonists: hydroquinone (10(-4) M); methylene blue (10(-4) M); and pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M) as it was in controls. It was similar to controls in group 3W-H + R. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is associated with a loss of EDRF activity in pulmonary vessels, with a rapid recovery on return to a normoxic environment. ',\n",

We tested the hypothesis that increased plasma glucagon concentration resulting from portal-systemic shunting or liver dysfunction causes arterial vasodilation and thereby stimulates sodium retention in cirrhosis. Twenty-seven studies were performed in patients with alcoholic liver disease, 11 of whom had ascites. Liver function was quantitated as the elimination rate of antipyrine, caffeine, and stable isotopes of cholic acid administered both orally (2,2,4,4-2H) and intravenously (24-13C). Portal-systemic shunt fraction was calculated as the ratio of the intravenous and oral clearances of the isotopes of cholic acid. Cardiac output was measured by using Doppler echocardiography. Plasma glucagon concentration was increased in patients with ascites when compared with that in patients without ascites (474 +/- 180 pg/ml vs 245 +/- 120 pg/ml, p = 0.0007) but was unrelated to urinary sodium excretion, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.48, 0.35, -0.13, 0.18, and 0.22, respectively). Plasma glucagon concentration correlated with the half-lives of all model compounds (r = 0.58, p = 0.002; r = 0.62, p = 0.0008; r = 0.62, p = 0.001; and r = 0.64, p = 0.0005; for caffeine, antipyrine, oral and intravenous cholic acid, respectively) but not with shunt fraction (r = 0.14). Increased plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is probably a result of diminished hepatic clearance. However, increased plasma concentration of glucagon does not appear to cause a hyperdynamic circulatory state or sodium retention. ',\n",

In order to evaluate the effects of one-year antihypertensive treatment on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, 65 patients whose diastolic blood pressure was in the range 95-120 mmHg were randomly allocated to groups that received either hydrochlorothiazide or metoprolol, or both drugs when the response to one of them was insufficient to control blood pressure. Blood pressure was effectively reduced in all groups. Patients on hydrochlorothiazide showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 3 months of treatment. A significant increase in triglycerides was observed after 6 and 12 months, together with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 12 months (P less than 0.05) of treatment in patients on metoprolol. In patients treated with both hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol, total cholesterol increased after 3 (P less than 0.001) and 6 months (P less than 0.05), triglycerides increased after 6 (P less than 0.01) and 12 months (P less than 0.01), and LDL-C increased after 3 (P less than 0.05), 6 (P less than 0.001) and 12 months (P less than 0.01) of treatment, respectively. In 61% of the patients, three or more lipid parameters were affected during the study period. We conclude that long-term antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and particularly with both drugs, can induce lipid effects that deserve recognition, because in some cases these might counteract the possible benefit of a reduction in blood pressure on the prevention of coronary heart disease.

Because the data on the antigenic phenotype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) are incomplete and somewhat disparate, 45 MECs were evaluated immunohistochemically for low- and high-molecular-weight keratins, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, smooth muscle actin, and S-100 protein. Tumors stained uniformly for keratins and, on occasion, focally for vimentin. Tumors were nonreactive with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein and, with few exceptions, to muscle-specific actins and S-100 protein. Clear cell and papillary histologic variants were seen as potential diagnostic pitfalls. If used with hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections, limited potential is seen for this antibody panel in surgical pathology. Myoepithelial cell-associated antigens are expressed to a very limited extent in MECs. ',\n",

The study group included 20 patients with vena caval thrombi from renal cell carcinoma (18), renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (1) and adrenal pheochromocytoma (1). Preoperative diagnostic studies included magnetic resonance imaging in all patients, inferior venacavography in 16 and computerized tomography scanning in 15. All patients underwent an operation in which the presence and extent of the vena caval thrombus were confirmed. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately delineated the presence and extent of the thrombus in all 20 patients (100%). Venacavography was accurate in 15 patients (94%) but 8 (50%) required a retrograde and antegrade study. Computerized tomography scanning demonstrated the presence of a tumor thrombus in all 15 patients but accurately delineated the cephalad extent of the thrombus in only 5 (33%). In patients with vena caval tumor thrombi magnetic resonance imaging can provide accurate information regarding the extent of vena caval involvement while avoiding the need for an invasive contrast imaging study.

Based on observations of changes in muscle function associated with aging, and the exacerbation of these changes with frailty, a program of muscle strengthening has been developed to correct specific defects in muscles. This pilot study was undertaken on 18 functionally impaired nursing home residents (age range 60 to 90 years) with markedly deteriorated muscle function (50%) secondary to age, disuse, and multiple chronic illnesses. Fourteen of the subjects completed the six-week program without adverse effects. In 75% of the patients, there was improved muscle function, with endurance, strength, and speed increasing 35%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. After the program, many subjects increased their spontaneous activity and decreased their dependency. The improvements were still evident four months after rehabilitation. These results suggest that it may be possible, through a carefully supervised, short-term program of muscle rehabilitation, for nursing home residents to achieve an enhanced level of physical functioning.

Patients were prospectively randomized to high-dose (250,000 U/h for 4 hours and then 125,000 U/h) or low-dose (50,000 U/h) regimens. The mean time to complete lysis was 20.8, 26.0, 16.5, and 18.2 hours for the high-dose artery, low-dose artery, high-dose graft, and low-dose graft groups, respectively (P was not significant). Respective mean infusion durations were 27.1, 35.4, 22.2, and 25.3 hours. Clinical success was achieved in 65%-85% of cases.

Hemodynamic events and structural vascular changes of the gastric mucosa in cirrhotics have caught the attention of investigators in the recent past, but as yet it is not known whether therapeutic interruption of variceal blood flow at gastroesophageal level alters such portal hypertensive mucosal features. The newly developed endoscopic laser-Doppler technique was used to assess whether variceal eradication by means of endoscopic sclerotherapy influences the gastric mucosal congestion in portal hypertension patients. Gastric mucosal blood flow was determined at ten defined sites of the stomach, before the first session of sclerotherapy and after complete variceal eradication had been achieved in 15 patients. A statistically significant decrease (P less than 0.01 to 0.05) in microcirculation was found at the gastric antrum and corpus, an increase at the pylorus (P less than 0.05), but no change in the fundic area.

       " 593: 'Erythropoietin receptors induced by dimethyl sulfoxide exhibit positive cooperativity associated with an amplified biologic response. Erythropoietin triggers the differentiation of erythrocyte progenitors by binding to receptors on their plasma membrane. We report here that pretreatment of erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cells with chemical inducers resulted in a striking increase in erythropoietin-specific hemoglobinization. This amplification of the erythropoietin biologic response was accompanied by the induction of a new population of high-density receptors (approximately 20,000 per cell) exhibiting marked positive cooperativity. Erythropoietin binding to new receptors displayed a convex upward Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 6.75. Measurement of erythropoietin receptor mRNA demonstrated an initial decrease in receptor transcript followed by an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase after 24-48 hr. This increase in receptor message does not appear to account for the magnitude of the receptor up-regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide. We propose that this positive cooperativity reflects the interaction (clustering) of receptors, presumably through the formation of homooligomers or heterooligomers, and that this receptor interaction may amplify the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway.

The immediate pathophysiological process responsible for sudden cardiac death is a lethal arrhythmia, usually ventricular fibrillation. Although significant coronary atherosclerosis is present in most cases of naturally occurring sudden death, available evidence indicates that several mechanisms can be operative in the pathogenesis of the fatal event. These are (1) acute myocardial infarction in a minority of cases; (2) myocardial ischemia, without infarction, which is initiated either by (a) an exertion-induced increase in myocardial oxygen demand or (b) an acute coronary event often involving plaque degeneration and platelet aggregation; and (3) a primary arrhythmia, usually resulting from altered electrical conduction in the setting of a previous myocardial infarction.

Eleven IRP were placed in the ascending aorta, two in the transverse arch, and 11 in the descending aorta. Pathology included acute aortic dissection in four patients, chronic dissection in four, and aortic aneurysm in 16. There were eight hospital deaths (35%). Causes of death included acute cardiac failure in seven patients, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in one. IRP complications requiring revision included right coronary artery occlusion in three of 11 patients (27%) with an IRP in the ascending aorta. Graft revision was also required in three of 11 IRP implanted in the descending aorta (27%), due to graft occlusion in one and graft stenosis in two. Of the six patients with IRP complications, there were three hospital deaths (50%). All 15 hospital survivors were followed for a mean of 68.5 months, range 5-112 months. There were four late deaths (26.7%). Causes of late death included hemoptysis in one, cardiomyopathy in one, and aortic redissection and rupture in two.

Five patients had stage IIB disease, and 44 had stage III or IV disease. Thirty-five (71%) patients achieved a complete remission with MOPP chemotherapy. Fourteen (40%) of the complete responders relapsed, but four of these achieved durable remissions in response to subsequent therapy. Thirty (61%) patients have died (14 induction failures, nine relapsed patients, seven complete responders in remission). Thus, with a median follow-up of 20 years (range, 15 to 23), the overall survival for the group is 39%, and the disease-free survival for the complete responders is 60%. A subset of 10 patients received mantle radiation therapy after maximal response to MOPP. One of these patients failed to achieve complete remission, but among the nine complete responders only one has relapsed. In contrast, 13 of 26 (50%) patients achieving a complete response to MOPP alone have relapsed (P2 = .0536). Although MOPP alone was not prospectively compared with MOPP plus radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease in this series, the retrospective analysis shows a nearly significant difference in disease-free survival favoring combined modality treatment. The difference in tumor mortality between MOPP-treated (44%) and combined modality-treated patients (80%) was also nearly significant (P2 = .055). However, overall survival differences between patients treated with MOPP alone and those treated with combined modality therapy were not significantly different (P2 = 0.23) because of the mortality related to late complications of combined modality treatment. \",\n",

Acute cerebral ischemia increases the generation of free radicals, causing cell damage, and theoretically may decrease the activity of the scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase. To investigate the role of superoxide dismutase in cerebral ischemia, we used a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. In this model an infarct is produced in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortices, extending into the lateral basal ganglia. We measured superoxide dismutase activity by using the xanthine oxidase cytochrome c reduction assay in these areas of rat brains. Tissue samples were analyzed 20 minutes, 2, 6, or 24 hours, or 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion and 2 or 24 hours or 7 days after sham operation (n = 8-10 at each time). There was no significant change in superoxide dismutase activity relative to control values in any brain area at any time up to 24 hours after surgery. However, 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion a significant decline in superoxide dismutase activity, to 55%-68% (p less than 0.05) of that in unoperated controls, was observed in all brain areas. Our results do not support an important role for changes in the activity of endogenous superoxide dismutase during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. However, the decrease in superoxide dismutase activity 7 days after ischemia could indicate ongoing additional damage to peri-infarct tissue. ',\n",

Out of a personal series of 124 acoustic neurinomas treated over the past 35 years, the senior author has undertaken a radical intracapsular approach in 12 patients with large tumors (greater than 3 cm in diameter). Surgical indications for intracapsular removal included advanced age (five cases), the patient's wish to avoid any risk of facial paralysis (six cases), contralateral facial palsy (one case), and contralateral deafness (one case). Eleven of these 12 patients were available for follow-up review. Tumor recurrence developed in two patients (18%) at 2 and 3 years postoperatively; there were no late recurrences. Four patients died of unrelated causes, 10 to 19 years after surgery. The remaining five patients have survived a mean of 12 years since surgery without recurrence (range 3 to 22 years).

Irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for the entry complaints. This determination was made by two other board-certified gastroenterologists after patients had been in the study for 9 months. These raters were independent of the study and rated the transcripts of patients' clinic visits, all other available clinical data from this and other clinics, all laboratory data obtained during the 9-month study period, and the results of a 9-month telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the study population had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome for this study. A similar proportion and type of organic disease and irritable bowel syndrome were experienced by men and women. For the total sample of 97 subjects, the correlation of the Manning criteria with irritable bowel syndrome was 0.22 (P less than 0.01).

Most strictures occur as a result of injury to the bile duct during cholecystectomy. In addition, strictures can occur at the site of previous biliary anastomoses for reconstruction of the biliary tree. Most patients with benign bile duct strictures present soon after their initial operation; however, in some cases, presentation is delayed for years. Cholangiography is essential for defining the anatomy of the biliary tree prior to management. In many cases, nonoperative biliary drainage is useful to treat sepsis and biliary fistulas. A number of alternatives exist for elective repair of bile duct strictures. Experience would suggest, however, that a choledochojejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy performed through a Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum is the preferable management in most cases. Postoperative biliary stenting may be valuable in optimizing the results. Nonoperative management by percutaneous transhepatic or endoscopic balloon dilatation has been reported to be successful in a number of small series. Long-term results are limited, however.

To improve the localization of stereotactic targets, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from the thalamus and subthalamic area using a specially designed semimicroelectrode in 61 patients and a conventional \"macroelectrode\" in 17 patients. By means of the semimicroelectrode, median nerve stimulation evoked two distinct SEPs, consisting of a diphasic wave with a huge positivity restricted to the nucleus ventrocaudalis (Vc) and a triphasic wave of lower amplitude with a major negativity in the ventral part of the nucleus ventrointermedius (Vim) and nucleus ventrooralis posterior (Vop) as well as the subthalamic lemniscal pathway. The Vim-Vc junction could thus be clearly delineated by an abrupt transition of SEPs from one type to the other with a precision of 1 mm. The parvicellular part of the Vc (Vcpc), situated in its basal region, was distinguishable from the Vc proper by a significant reduction of the positivity elicited by stimulation of the median nerve and by a rapid growth of a diphasic SEPs to stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve. In the other thalamic nuclei, stimulation of the median nerve elicited triphasic SEPs of a very small amplitude, suggesting a volume conduction current from the lemniscal pathway. With the macroelectrode, the positivity in the Vc was sensitive to electrode manipulation and the thalamic nuclei could not be distinctly outlined. SEP monitoring using the semimicroelectrode significantly improved the precision of target localization, which allowed minimizing of the volume of the therapeutic lesion without losing surgical effectiveness, while avoiding complications associated with increased penetration of the coagulating electrode. It is suggested that recording serial thalamic SEPs with the semimicroelectrode is a practical method to refine stereotactic targets in the thalamus. ',\n",

To determine the effect of data compression on diagnostic accuracy, observer tests were performed with 60 digitized chest radiographs (2,048 x 2,048 matrix, 1,024 shades of gray) containing subtle examples of pneumothorax, interstitial infiltrate, nodules, and bone lesions. Radiographs with no compression, with 25:1 compression, and with 50:1 compression ratios were presented in randomized order to 12 radiologists.

We report a case of multiple duodenal ulcers with gastric hypersecretion due to a nongastrin secretagogue produced by a malignant tumor of the pancreas in a 78-year-old man. The case resembled a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with high acid output (basal acid output 27, sham meal-stimulated 37, maximum acid output 47 mEq/h), but with fasting gastrin 43 pg/ml, nonresponsive to secretin. As in ZES, pepsin output was comparatively low, and secretion was inhibitable by atropine (50% inhibited by 1 microM). The tumor removed at surgery contained less than 1 ng gastrin per gram, but was many times more potent than pentagastrin in stimulating acid from a lumen-perfused rat stomach. The tumor also contained cholecystokinin (CCK-8 and CCK-33), motilin, insulin, and somatostatin, which were also present in adjacent normal pancreas; in addition, the tumor contained pancreatic polypeptide and pancreatic cancer-associated antigen. This case represents a rare syndrome due to an as yet undefined peptide secreted by a (frequently malignant) pancreatic endocrine tumor and masquerading as ZES.

The structural and ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction in the number of follicles which were otherwise normal. No follicles were found in the thin sections from two of the three postmenarcheal girls, whereas normal follicles were observed in the third. The cortical stroma showed moderate to severe signs of fibrosis and changes of capillaries. All of these alterations were more evident in patients where ALL was diagnosed at an older age and this finding suggests that they are at a higher risk for low fertility or early menopause. ',\n",

Twenty-four patients underwent biopsy or resection of the liver for focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1978 to 1988. Twenty-two of the patients were women. The mean age was 35 years. A history of antecedent oral contraceptive or conjugated estrogen (Premarin) use was obtained in 18 of 21 women. There were two men, aged 26 and 37 years; neither gave a history of hormone use. Most of the tumors were solitary (22 of 24) and located in the left lobe of the liver (17 of 22). Fifteen of the patients had a prior or simultaneous malignant lesion and six had other benign tumors. Most of the tumors were resected with a wedge or subsegment of liver (13 of 24). Four patients underwent segmentectomy and five required lobectomy for removal of the tumors. Two patients had an intraoperative biopsy only. The patients in whom the tumor was diagnosed preoperatively underwent computed tomography and arteriography routinely. Scintigraphy of the liver with sulfur colloid was obtained in only three patients, despite its distinct potential for nonoperative diagnosis of FNH. ',\n",

The recent availability of Y DNA probes has made it possible to identify two forms of 46,XX male syndrome: Y DNA positive and Y DNA negative. The Y DNA positive male results from a X;Y translocation with a low recurrence risk; the Y DNA negative males are due to a mutation with a high recurrence risk. 46,XX males and mosaic forms are phenotypically indistinguishable. A review of the case histories for 11 individuals indicates that affected males have highly variable genital and nongenital phenotypes. Physical findings may be clearly apparent or nonexistent. With the exception of external genitalia, the basis for this variability is unknown. It may be related to differences in Y chromatin expression as the result of variable inactivation of the X chromosomes, or to the existence of minor deletions or point mutations secondary to an exchange of genetic material. Common and uncommon clinical problems in these individuals require evaluation and follow-up care that is provided through a cooperative, interdisciplinary approach. ',\n",

DESIGN: Retrospective clinical review. SETTING: Level I trauma center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred fourteen adult injured patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When an ISS of more than 9 was used as the definition of major trauma, the ISS undercorrelated 11% of the time with the need for any one procedure. When an ISS of more than 14 was used as the definition, it undercorrelated 20% of the time. CONCLUSION: The ISS may not be completely correlated with the resource requirements of injured patients and should not be used as the sole means by which to define major injury. ',\n",

Achieving reduced mortality rates in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic abscess is possible by employing a comprehensive management plan. Components of the plan include (1) rapid evaluation and assessment of the degree of physiologic and anatomic derangement, the latter by the prompt use of vascular enhanced computed tomographic scan; (2) adequate fluid resuscitation determined by early institution of advanced hemodynamic monitoring; (3) attempts to identify and document septic foci via computed tomography-guided percutaneous aspiration; and (4) aggressive surgical debridement. Close adherence to these policies allowed us to keep mortality in this seriously ill group of patients to 14%. Most deaths occurred in patients who were referred to this service late in the course of their disease. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Enquiry (APACHE) II severity of illness index applied at the time of admission proved an accurate predictor of mortality. A score of 25 or greater was highly predictive of death, and a lesser score, of survival. ',\n",

The basis of early ischemic contractile failure was investigated in perfused ferret hearts at 27 degrees C. Isovolumic left ventricular developed pressure fell by more than 50% within 30 seconds of the onset of total global ischemia and reached zero by 5 minutes. Monophasic action potential recordings revealed no decrease in excitability during this period. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained at 30-second resolution showed no significant changes in inorganic phosphate or phosphocreatine during the first 30 seconds of ischemia. Intracellular pH (pHi) and ATP changed even more slowly; therefore, none of these metabolites could account for the rapid fall in force. To gauge the contribution of intravascular pressure, we compared ordinary aortic flow occlusion with tissue-level ischemia induced by massive coronary microembolization at the level of the precapillary arterioles. Functional depression developed significantly more slowly in the microembolized hearts, despite accumulation of inorganic phosphate and protons comparable with that in ordinary ischemia. After microembolization, the time course of functional depression reflected much more closely the concomitant inorganic phosphate and pHi changes. Thus, our results provide novel evidence supporting the importance of vascular collapse in the mechanism of early ischemic contractile failure. ',\n",

The effect of hypothyroidism on non-specific bronchial reactivity was studied in 11 patients without pulmonary disease (mean age 40 (SD 13) years) who had had a total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer 41 (36) months before the study. All patients when mildly hyperthyroid while having long term thyroxine replacement treatment and once when hypothyroid two weeks after stopping triiodothyronine for the purpose of screening for metastases. Bronchial reactivity was assessed by measuring specific airways conductance (sGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled carbachol (45-1260 micrograms). The dose producing a 35% decrease in sGaw (PD35) was determined from the cumulative log dose-response curve by linear regression analysis. Mean baseline sGaw values were similar when the patients were hypothyroid and when they were hyperthyroid (1.35 (0.36) and 1.41 (0.56) s-1 kPa-1). The interstudy coefficients of variation of baseline sGaw were higher in the thyroid patients than in a euthyroid control group (14% versus 8%). Geometric mean PD35 was lower when the patients were hypothyroid (97 micrograms) than when they were mildly hyperthyroid (192 micrograms). It is concluded that acute hypothyroidism increases non-specific bronchial reactivity in nonasthmatic subjects. ',\n",

To investigate whether early changes in the transformation of normal ovarian epithelial cells into tumor cells can be detected with monoclonal antibodies, a comparative immunohistochemical study was performed on normal human ovarian mesothelial cells, cystomas, cystadenomas, ovarian carcinomas, as well as granulosa cell tumor. Using monoclonal antibodies against different keratin subtypes, it was shown that mesothelial cells, ovarian cysts, cystadenomas, and carcinomas all reacted positively with broad-spectrum anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as with MAbs to keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19. Keratins 4 and 13 were not found in mesothelial cells, but positive groups of cells were identified in several cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas. While mesothelial cells did not react with the pan-epithelial marker BW495/36, invaginating metaplastic mesothelial cells, inclusion cysts, cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas showed an increasing reactivity with BW495/36, with an increasing degree of malignancy. The reactivity of MAbs against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OV-TL 3, OC 125, MOv 18, and OV-TL 10) was limited to weak staining reaction in some mesothelial cells but were found to be positive on more than 50% of the ovarian cystadenomas and more than 90% of the ovarian carcinomas. Thecal and granulosa cells of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles all reacted positively with antibodies to the broad-spectrum keratins OV-TL 12/5 and RCK 102, and to keratins 8 and 18, but not with keratins 4, 7, 13, and 19. These keratins decreased or disappeared in granulosa cells of mature follicles (Graafian follicles), whereas granulosa cell tumors did not react with anti-keratin antibodies. The reactivity of BW 495/36 was negative or limited to traces in some granulosa cells. Ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were not expressed in granulosa cells or granulosa cell tumors. The data indicate that mesothelial cells undergoing metaplastic changes finally resulting in ovarian cystadenomas (and carcinomas) initiate the synthesis of a 200-kd glycoprotein recognized by MAb (BW 495/36), the production of ovarian carcinoma associated antigens, in addition to focal production of keratin 4 and/or 13, as seen in several samples. The granulosa cell tumors decrease or switch off their keratin production and remain negative for the 200-kd glycoprotein and the ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens. ',\n",

Genetic counseling concerning the risks of chromosomal abnormalities in twin gestations can be difficult; the risk of amniocentesis is weighed against that of chromosomal abnormalities in either one or both of the twins. Because most twins are dizygotic (each with a risk a priori of aneuploidy), the chance that one of the fetuses is affected is greater than would be expected for a singleton. Only three possibilities would result in either one or both twin's being affected: 1) dizygotic twins with one fetus affected, 2) dizygotic twins with both fetuses affected, and 3) monozygotic twins with both fetuses affected. Using existing tables of estimated risks of chromosomal abnormalities in singleton gestations and mathematically derived formulas, we created tables defining the age-related risks of chromosomal abnormalities in twin gestations. According to these tables, a patient at 33 years of age with a twin gestation has a risk of Down syndrome in at least one of her twins equivalent to that of a 35-year-old with a singleton. Prenatal genetic testing should be considered for women with twins at a younger age than the traditional 35. \",\n",

Three hemophilia B patients with anti-factor IX antibodies who had no detectable gross deletion of the factor IX gene by Southern blotting analysis were investigated at the molecular level. All eight exons, accompanied by their splicing junction sites and presumptive promoter regions of the factor IX gene in these patients (total 5.5 kb in length) were amplified with the use of the polymerase chain reaction, followed by complete nucleotide sequence analysis. Three different types of novel single base substitutions and a 2 base-pair nucleotide deletion were identified. Patient HB-5 had two point mutations in his factor IX gene. One was located at the promoter region at nucleotide -793 and the other (C-to-T transition) was found in exon VI of the gene changing Gln-191 to a stop codon. Patient HB-6 had a point mutation (G-to-A) in the splice acceptor site, which interrupted the normal splicing of the last intron G. A small two-nucleotide deletion in exon III was detected in patient HB-7 and yielded frameshifted amino acids and terminated by a stop codon. These resuslts suggest that not only the gross gene deletion of factor IX gene but also the point mutations or small nucleotide deletion that may cause the interruption of coding informations for mature protein synthesis is predisposed to development of anti-factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia B.

In paired experiments, we studied the effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on the acute pulmonary injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolization in 19 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. We compared the effect of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg intravenous bolus) given before embolization, early (1 H) in the course of embolization, late (3 h) in the course of embolization, or after embolization (at the beginning of the recovery period). We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and lymph dynamics. In six sheep we also fixed lung tissue for semiquantitative histology, and in some we measured leukocyte concentrations in blood and in pulmonary lymph. Methylprednisolone did not significantly affect pulmonary hemodynamics but it largely prevented lung injury when it was given before embolization. It also lessened the degree of lung injury when it was given during embolization, although this effect became less marked as treatment was delayed. Methylprednisolone had no effect on lung injury when given after embolization was completed (4 h). We found fewer leukocytes attached to air emboli and fewer endothelial cell gaps in the lungs of sheep given methylprednisolone as prophylaxis. Leukocyte counts were lower in lung lymph and higher in the circulating blood of methylprednisolone-treated sheep. We conclude that methylprednisolone has a preventive effect on air embolism lung injury, such that its effect is greater when given earlier during the development of injury. ',\n",

The study investigated the relationship between length of hospitalization and increasing cognitive deficit in schizophrenics. Using Halstead-Reitan Battery data obtained from 245 schizophrenic patients, multiple regression analyses were performed using age, education, and length of hospitalization as independent variables and various summary test indices as dependent variables. These analyses showed that there was not a statistically significant change in percentage of explained variance when length of hospitalization was entered into the multiple regression equations.

Inadequate tissue oxygenation may occur in critically ill patients with sepsis despite an apparently adequate O2 transport (QO2), and this may contribute to the development of an O2 debt and also to multiple organ failure. It has been shown that increasing QO2 by infusing a vasodilator may reveal this O2 debt in septic patients. To investigate whether the site of action of vasodilators may be of importance in unmasking such an O2 debt, we administered prostacyclin, a prostaglandin with a preferential effect on the microcirculation, and phentolamine, an arteriolar vasodilator, in 11 patients studied during the first 48 hours after the onset of sepsis, and compared their effect on whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) and skin microvascular blood flow. The results demonstrated that increasing QO2 by prostacyclin but not by phentolamine significantly increases VO2 in critically ill patients with sepsis. The site of action of vasodilators may therefore play an important role in their ability to unmask an O2 debt. ',\n",

Benign bone lesions in children are often so large in size that there is not an adequate amount of bone available for an autograft to fill the resultant cavity after surgical curettage. This study compared autografts and allografts with respect to the time required and the success of graft incorporation. Fifty-four patients with 61 lesions were studied. Lesions were classified as small volume (less than 60 cc) or large volume (more than 60 cc) and were separated into four groups: small-volume autograft, large-volume autograft, small-volume allograft, and large-volume allograft. Allografts appeared comparable to autografts when small-volume lesions were treated. The healing time was slightly longer for allografts with an average period of 21 months versus 27 months for autografts. Autografts were superior to allografts in rate and completeness of healing for solitary large lesions. This increased efficacy presumes a somewhat older child in which an adequate amount of bone is available for an autograft. A young child with multicentric or polyostotic lesions can still achieve successful incorporation with allografts. In this study, 38% healed completely and 29% healed partially. Allografts have a distinct place in the treatment of benign bone lesions in children. ',\n",

Angioplasty causes substantial injury to the coronary artery intima and media that is unrecognizable by angiography. On the basis of a substantial body of research in oncology and wound healing, it is hypothesized that restenosis is a manifestation of the general wound healing response expressed specifically in vascular tissue. The temporal response to injury occurs in three characteristic phases: inflammation, granulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. The specific expression of these phases in the coronary artery leads to intimal hyperplasia at 1 to 4 months. The major milestones in the temporal sequence of restenosis are platelet aggregation, inflammatory cell infiltration, release of growth factors, medial smooth muscle cell modulation and proliferation, proteoglycan deposition and extracellular matrix remodeling. Each step has potential inhibitors that could be used for preventive therapy. Resolution of restenosis, however, probably requires both creation of the largest possible residual lumen and substantial inhibition of intimal hyperplasia. ',\n",

Two methods of serial electrophysiologic testing are in widespread use. Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study and a new catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test. An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing. Little is known about differences between these two methods with respect to the likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications. To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an indwelling catheter, a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients. Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an indwelling catheter, a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter. Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters. No differences were found between the indwelling and new catheter tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion. Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the indwelling catheter. Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the indwelling catheter (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all). There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications. ',\n",

Local control was significantly related to the initial status of the primary, to the tumor regression at the end of the radiation therapy, and to the histologic differentiation. The 2-year local control was 96% for T1 lesions, 57% for T2 lesions, 45% for T3 lesions, and 23% for T4 lesions. Local control was 70% if the tumor regression was complete at the end of the treatment and 27% if the tumor regression was partial. No significant differences were found in primary local control with respect to degree of infiltration, age, and dose of radiation therapy over a dose of 60 Gy in 6 weeks. The 3-year regional control was 86% for N0, 78% for N1, and 60% for N2 and N3.

The authors analyzed the relationship between treatment, local recurrence, and metastases in a population-based series of 375 patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and the trunk wall. Treatment was inadequate (marginal excision alone) in 107 patients, local recurrence occurred in 112, and 128 patients developed metastases. Local recurrence was 3.5 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate and 2.5 times more common in patients with metastases than in those without. However, metastases were only 1.2 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate. Of the 128 patients who developed metastases, 63 had local recurrence and 65 had not. In these two subgroups the timing of metastases and the distribution of clinicopathologic factors--age, sex, tumor size, localization, depth, histotype, and malignancy grade--were similar. These findings indicate that local recurrence is of minor importance for development of metastases in soft tissue sarcoma. The increased local recurrence rate in metastatic tumors may be an expression of the aggressiveness of the primary tumor; highly malignant tumors combine a potential both for local and distant spread.

The two-site protocol is similar to the standard protocol but delivers the last extrastimulus via a second spatially separated right ventricular catheter. Patients were divided into two groups based on indications for study: group 1 included 45 patients with syncope, nonsustained VT, or both, and group 2 included 32 patients with a history of sustained VT, sudden cardiac death, or both. The yield of VT induction with the short-to-long protocol was less than that with the standard protocol. In none of the patients in group 1 in whom the standard protocol results were negative did the short-to-long protocol produce sustained VT. Only two patients, both in group 2, had sustained arrhythmias induced by the short-to-long protocol when the standard protocol results were negative: one had sustained VT induced and one with long QT syndrome had ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced with the short-to-long protocol. However, the short-to-long protocol failed to induce sustained VT in seven patients in whom the standard protocol produced sustained VT. All seven of these patients required three extrastimuli with the standard protocol for induction of VT. ',\n",

One hundred forty-eight members of 53 kindreds with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) were examined for congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) and extracolonic manifestations (ECM) to assess the value of CHRPE as a predictive marker for FAP. Based on eye examination results, the families were divided into 2 groups. In a first group of 34 families, all 61 members diagnosed as having polyps and 13 of the 33 patients at risk had 4 or more lesions distributed in both eyes. By contrast, in a second group of 18 families, all 32 polyposis patients and all 18 members at risk had less than 4 lesions. Extra-colonic manifestations were present in 26 of 34 families in the first group and in 11 of 18 families in the second group. Data on one family with ambiguous ancestry were reviewed separately. The existence of 4 or more CHRPE lesions distributed in both eyes seems to be a congenital marker for FAP, present in 65.4 percent of families. When present in a family: 1) it is found in all diagnosed patients in that family, 2) can therefore be considered predictive for the development of polyps in other family members who carry the trait, and 3) if confirmed by longer follow-up, may possibly preclude members without the trait from further evaluation and surveillance.

From 1973 through 1987 25 patients underwent mitral valve replacement in the first year of life for mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation. The patients with mitral stenosis included two with mitral arcade, two with supravalvular mitral stenosis with hypoplastic mitral valve, and one with parachute mitral valve. Included in the group of patients with mitral regurgitation were 12 with atrioventricular canal defect, six with chordal and leaflet defects, one with Marfan's syndrome, and one with bacterial endocarditis. Prostheses included 12 Bjork-Shiley (17 mm), seven St. Jude Medical (19 mm in four, 21 mm in three), five stent-mounted dura mater valves (12 mm to 16 mm), and one porcine xenograft (19 mm). In four patients the valves were placed in the left atrium in a supraannular location. There were nine operative (atrioventricular canal defect seven, mitral regurgitation two) and five late (atrioventricular canal defect four, mitral stenosis one) deaths, giving actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates of 52% and 43%, respectively. All 6 patients with tissue valves died; the four with supraannular mitral valve replacement survived. Since 1983 operative mortality has been reduced to 0% (70% confidence limits 0% to 24%). Nine patients required a second mitral valve replacement for prosthetic stenosis 5 to 69 (mean 30) months after the original mitral valve replacement (one operative death). Because of improvements in repair of atrioventricular canal defect in infancy, the need for mitral valve replacement at atrioventricular canal defect repair has decreased. Although valvuloplasty has been advocated for repair of congenital mitral valve disease and is applicable in some infants with mitral regurgitation, mitral valve replacement is frequently unavoidable for congenital mitral disease and can now be accomplished at a low operative risk, even when the prosthesis has to be positioned supraannularly. \",\n",

As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ganciclovir in cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, the clinical characteristics of 44 patients enrolled at one center were analyzed in detail. All were homosexual men who had CMV on colonic biopsy. CMV colitis was the index diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 11 (25%) of the 44 patients. All had diarrhea, but it was intermittent in 13 patients (30%). Bleeding was uncommon, but 35 patients (80%) were febrile (median temperature of 38.9 degrees C). Weight loss was reported by 39 patients (89%), among whom the median loss was 6.8 kg. Endoscopy revealed normal colonic mucosa but CMV on biopsy in 11 patients (25%). Colonoscopic biopsies positive for CMV were found only in the cecum in 7 (39%) of 18 patients. Most patients (54%) had received zidovudine before the diagnosis of CMV colitis. The median time to the development of CMV colitis after the diagnosis of AIDS was 16 months in those patients who had received zidovudine and 3 months in those who had not (p less than 0.02). We conclude that CMV colitis can present early in AIDS and often with such nonspecific signs as fever, intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and hematochezia. Importantly, it can appear normal on colonoscopy and occurs frequently only in the right colon, necessitating full colonoscopy and multiple biopsies for accurate diagnosis. ',\n",

In the search for immunoreagents appropriate for the histopathologic diagnosis of malignant B-cell lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections, a new monoclonal antibody, Ki-B5, was generated using a high-grade B-cell lymphoma as the immunogene. Ki-B5 is a mouse IgG1/kappa that recognizes five protein fractions of about 84, 82, 55, 48, and 27 Kd after biosynthetic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. Protein fractions with the molecular weights of approximately 84 and 82 Kd were expressed on the cell surface and show that Ki-B5 is probably unrelated to CD45. It was possible through electron microscopy to visualize the membrane-bound portion of Ki-B5. Extensive immunohistologic studies on normal human tissue and various neoplasias demonstrated the high specificity of Ki-B5 to normal human B cells and a minor subgroup of plasma cells. Except for ML-2, which is a myelomonocytic human cell line, Ki-B5 exclusively recognized the B-cell lineage, including EB-3, BALL-1, and NALM-1. All carcinomas, sarcomas, and malignant melanomas tested with Ki-B5 were negative. Although normal granulocytes and monocytes were constantly negative, three of eight myelomonocytic leukemias coreacted with this antibody. Eight of the 57 T-cell lymphomas studied were positive to Ki-B5. Five were classified as lymphoblastic, two represented T8-CLL, and one was classified as immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Only 3 of 126 cases of B-cell lymphoma, including rare types not considered in the current classifications, were negative to Ki-B5. Plasmacytomas were also negative, except for one case. Irrespective of the cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma and plasmacytoma, Ki-B5 represents a new monoclonal antibody appropriate for the diagnosis and immunophenotyping of malignant lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections.

Large regenerative nodules in cirrhotic livers may accumulate iron and develop internal iron-poor foci of hyperplasia or malignancy. Magnetic resonance examinations were performed on 23 patients with biopsy-proved cirrhosis. A \"nodule-within-nodule\" appearance was noted in two patients. This appearance consisted of markedly low intensity of a large nodule on gradient-echo images, with one or two internal foci that were isointense to the liver. Each of the large nodules was 2 cm in diameter, and each of the internal foci was less than 1 cm. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal in both patients. Aspiration biopsy performed in one patient failed to show malignancy, but histologic confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma was obtained eventually in both cases. The nodule-within-nodule sign, which reflects the unique histopathology of hepatocellular carcinoma in large siderotic regenerative nodules, is strongly suggestive of early hepatocellular carcinoma, even if serologic markers and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.

The gait of 30 ambulatory adults between the ages of 47 and 79 years was studied using two-dimensional cinematography and force-plate data in a link-segment model. About 40% of the positive work required for walking was performed by the muscles of the affected side. Major contributors were the ankle plantar flexors, hip flexors, and hip extensors.

If the endotracheal tube was size 7.5 or greater, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was used, whereas if the endotracheal tube size was below 7, a rigid bronchoscope was used. For the diagnosis of lung rejection, the histology of biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 69% (similar to the result in adults). The histology also distinguished lung infection from rejection. Complications included three pneumothoraces and two clinically significant episodes of hemorrhage, one of which led to a cardiorespiratory arrest, which may have been caused by hypoxia. As a result, arterial oxygen saturation is now monitored during the procedure using a pulse oximeter. ',\n",
       " 646: 'The effects of tumor necrosis factor on intestinal structure and metabolism. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a polypeptide produced predominantly by activated macrophages, is an important mediator of sepsis. We analyzed the specific metabolic changes that occur in the gut following TNF administration. Following general anesthesia, hemodynamic and metabolic indices were measured serially in control dogs (n = 7) and animals receiving a continuous sublethal intravenous infusion of TNF (0.57.10(5) IU/kg/6 hours, n = 7). During TNF infusion mean arterial pressure gradually decreased despite fluid administration, which maintained wedge pressure and cardiac index, which were similar to control animals. While TNF significantly reduced intestinal blood flow to 12 +/- 3 mL/min/kg compared to 28 +/- 3 mL/min/kg (p less than 0.01) in controls, intestinal oxygen consumption was maintained due to an increased extraction rate. Despite hypoperfusion the intestinal exchange of metabolic substrate (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and ammonia) was comparable between the control and TNF-infused animals. However, when substrate carbon balance across the intestinal tract was calculated, it appeared that there was a limitation in fuel availability in the TNF animals. This may be due to competition for fuel between the gut and other major organs. Fuel limitation may jeopardize rapid cell proliferation and mucosal repair and with regional hypoperfusion these processes may account for the mucosal ulcerations observed at the termination of the study.

Also, to find out if the technique can predict whether manual aspiration will be successful, hence avoiding the need for intercostal tube drainage. DESIGN--Prospective study of 25 episodes of pneumothorax during which patients breathed air from a Douglas bag that contained chlorofluorocarbon gases from a metered dose inhaler while the pneumothorax was aspirated. SETTING--Medical unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--22 patients who presented over nine months with acute pneumothorax. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence or absence of chlorofluorocarbon marker gases in the aspirate. Presence or absence of sustained re-expansion of the affected lung in the chest radiograph. RESULTS--Marker gas was detected in the aspirate from 16 out of 25 pneumothoraces. Of these, 13 required intercostal tube drainage because of failure of the lung to re-expand. Marker gas was not detected in nine cases, and in all of these cases manual aspiration resulted in sustained re-expansion of the lung. CONCLUSIONS--The presence or absence of a pleural leak during manual aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax can be shown by using this technique. The absence of marker gas in the aspirate implies that manual aspiration will be successful, whereas its presence predicts, in most cases, either failure of manual aspiration to expand the lung or early re-collapse of the lung.

Descending influences on the spinal nociceptive tail-flick (TF) reflex produced by focal electrical stimulation and glutamate microinjection in the nuclei reticularis gigantocellularis (NGC) and gigantocellularis pars alpha (NGC alpha) were examined and characterized in rats lightly anesthetized with pentobarbital. Both inhibition and facilitation of the TF reflex were produced by electrical stimulation at identical sites in the NGC/NGC alpha; glutamate microinjection only inhibited the TF reflex. The chronaxie of stimulation for inhibition of the TF reflex was 169 +/- 28 microseconds. Inhibition of the TF reflex by stimulation was produced throughout the NGC and NGC alpha; intensities of stimulation for inhibition were least in the ventral NGC and in the NGC alpha. At threshold intensities of stimulation, inhibition of the TF reflex did not outlast the period of stimulation. Facilitation of the TF reflex was produced at many of the same sites at which stimulation inhibited the TF reflex, but always at lesser intensities of stimulation (mean, 10 microA vs. 43 microA for inhibition, n = 25). Stimulation in the NGC/NGC alpha at threshold intensities for facilitation or inhibition of the TF reflex did not significantly affect blood pressure. Strength-duration characterization of electrical stimulation and microinjection of glutamate into identical sites in the NGC and NGC alpha suggest that descending inhibition of the TF reflex results from activation of cell bodies in the NGC and NGC alpha.

In order to model crypt abscesses, a histological finding which correlates with disease activity in intestinal inflammation, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were layered onto monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line T84, a crypt-like epithelium which is capable of Cl- secretion. Such PMN-epithelial interaction had no substantial effect on monolayer integrity or function. However, when PMN were stimulated by conditions including those present naturally in the human colonic lumen, monolayers responded with a bumetanide-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) indicative of Cl- secretion, the basis of secretory diarrhea. This Isc response was induced by a neutrophil-derived secretagogue (NDS), which was only active when applied to the luminal surface of monolayers and did not require PMN-epithelial contact. NDS activity is resistant to boiling, acid, and trypsin and passes a 500 nominal mol wt cutoff filter. NDS activity is not secondary to the respiratory burst products O2- or H2O2 and does not appear to be a myeloperoxidase product. We speculate NDS elicited Cl- secretion may contribute to the secretory diarrhea seen in patients with intestinal inflammation and crypt abscesses. ',\n",

The present study assessed the preferential renal secretion and hepatic degradation of renin forms in humans. The renin form profile of secreted renal renin was determined before transplant in an ex vivo kidney donor perfusion system and compared with the peripheral plasma multiple renin form profile of normal subjects. The effect of hepatic degradation on renin forms was assessed in hepatic vein plasma in comparison with infrarenal vena cava plasma in hypertensive patients during renal vein renin studies. The results revealed a significantly greater proportion of the more basic forms in the perfusate of donor kidneys compared with normal plasma. In hypertensive patients the proportion of the more basic renin forms in the hepatic vein was significantly decreased in comparison with the infrarenal vena cava. Thus, the human kidney may preferentially secrete the more basic renin forms. In contrast, the liver preferentially degrades the more basic forms, giving these forms a shorter plasma half-life. The preferential secretion and clearance of the more basic forms of renin may contribute to short-term control of human renin-angiotensin system activity. ',\n",

To determine the frequency and significance of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in patients without clinical evidence of myocardial infarction, we reviewed the two-dimensional echocardiograms of 252 patients who had no history or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction and who subsequently underwent coronary angiography. Seventy-seven patients (31%) had one or more segmental wall motion abnormalities. Sixty-six of the 77 patients (86%) had significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter stenosis). Seventy-four percent of the patients with coronary artery disease had multivessel disease. The left ventricle was divided into anterior and posterior regions. In the 66 patients, there were 77 separate regions with wall motion abnormalities (49 hypokinesis, 22 akinesis, 6 dyskinesis), including 60 regions (78%) supplied by coronary vessels with greater than or equal to 70% stenosis. Thirty-two patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Follow-up echocardiograms were obtained in 19 patients who had wall motion abnormalities involving 22 regions. Twenty of the 22 regions were revascularized. Wall motion improved in 17 of 20 regions (85%) and returned to normal in 15 regions (75%). We conclude that segmental wall motion abnormalities may be detected by echocardiography in up to one third of patients evaluated for suspected coronary artery disease without documented myocardial infarction. These abnormalities are associated with a high likelihood of multivessel disease as well as with significant narrowing of the artery supplying the region demonstrating abnormal wall motion. Improvement in segmental wall motion abnormalities after revascularization suggests that these areas represent regions of hibernating myocardium. ',\n",

       " 657: 'Acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis: a review of treatment approaches. Some authors describe acute bacterial prostatitis as a self-limiting disease, and as with any other acute septic condition, parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated. Chronic bacterial prostatitis, however, is associated with a causative organism persisting unaltered in prostatic fluid and leading to relapsing urinary tract infections. In the 1970s, several workers produced a classification system and bacteriologic localization cultures for establishing the diagnosis of prostatitis. Krieger and Crawford point to an important factor that is omitted in many clinical trials with episodes of chronic bacterial prostatitis in men. If localization studies of the prostate infection are attempted in the presence of bacteriuria, the urine must be sterilized with nitrofurantoin or penicillin G. Urine cultures obtained from first-voided urine, bladder urine, and urine voided after prostatic massage should show no growth, and the expressed prostatic secretion can then be examined for evidence of prostatic infection. This procedure reduces the contamination of the expressed prostatic secretion by the organism from the urinary tract infection. This is important, because antibiotic treatment is determined by the sensitivity of the organism isolated from the prostate as well as by the ability of the antibiotics to penetrate the prostate. Meares outlines the pharmacokinetic features needed for drug diffusion into prostatic fluid and provides detailed information on the physical characteristics of the prostate during acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Unfortunately, the choice of an ideal drug cannot be extrapolated from this information because pharmacodynamic principles cannot predict clinical efficacy. Some authors find that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim has the best cure rate in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. ',\n",

Through 2 h of CPB and the following 6 h of critical care, there was no difference between CPB-12 and CPB-16 regarding most cardiopulmonary functional variables. Plasma epinephrine was markedly elevated immediately after initiation of CPB (p less than .01 at 1 min CPB vs. basal) and returned rapidly to basal concentrations. Comparison of plasma epinephrine levels between CPB and standard CPR groups showed that responses to cardiac arrest were similar (p greater than .05 at 1 min CPB vs. 11.5 min CPR).

A variety of perturbations of calcium metabolism are reported to occur in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) compared to its genetic control the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY), including significant dysfunction of calcium handling by the proximal renal tubule of the SHR, resulting in impaired active calcium transport in the gut and an apparent renal calcium leak. We explored the intestinal and renal epithelia of 12- to 14-week-old SHR and WKY using electron microscopy. Biochemical comparisons of these transport epithelia included measurements of three vitamin D dependent cellular proteins and one structural protein: alkaline phosphatase, intestinal CaBP9K, renal CaBP28K, and villin expression. Electron microscopy demonstrated a patchy loss in microvilli in the SHR, accounting for approximately 10 to 15% of the total microvillar surface. In the kidney, morphological abnormalities were observed only in the proximal renal tubule. Again, there was patchy loss of microvilli from the brush border membrane. In SHR duodenal alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly reduced compared to the WKY (0.145 +/- 0.002 v 0.186 +/- 0.002 integrated extinction/min/micron 3 X 10(3) brush border (P less than .001). Duodenal CaBP9K and renal CaBP28K were significantly reduced in SHR compared to WKY. There were no differences in villin expression. These data are consistent with the previously characterized disturbances of active calcium transport in the intestine and inappropriate renal calcium leak in the SHR. While a possible link between these disturbances and hypertension remains to be determined, this study provides supportive evidence for a primary disturbance in cell calcium handling and transporting epithelia in this form of genetic hypertension.

Squamous cell carcinoma cell lines KB, Si Ha, HEp-2, and Fa Du showed high anchorage independency, and MS 751 and A-253 cell lines had minimum independency. However, the normal keratinocytes and the A-431 cell line did not show anchorage-independent growth.

The expression of proto-oncogenes from the monolayer cultures of the cancer cell lines is poorly correlated with the anchorage independency of the cells.

The charts of 48 patients with Gaucher's disease undergoing splenectomy at our institution between January 1963 and December 1989 were analyzed to determine the short- and long-term results of this procedure. Thirty-five (73%) patients had total splenectomy, whereas 13 (27%) patients had partial splenectomy. There was one postoperative death (after total splenectomy), and 13 patients (27%) had postoperative complications. Eleven patients (23%) presented with accelerated bone disease after total splenectomy (mean follow-up: 96 months). No patients having partial splenectomy (mean follow-up: 25 months) developed progressive bone disease. Eight patients have died since surgery. All four deaths due to malignant disease occurred in patients after total splenectomy. The results of this largest-ever reported series of splenectomy for Gaucher's disease confirm that while either total or partial splenectomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality, total splenectomy is accompanied by more aggressive bone disease and a predisposition to malignancy. Prospective, randomized trials are needed to substantiate whether partial splenectomy is indeed the treatment of choice for splenomegaly associated with Gaucher's disease. \",\n",

We describe a patient with severe alcoholic hepatitis, markedly elevated white blood cell count, and high fever. After review of the English literature, we discovered reports of other cases similar to our case. The striking feature in all of these cases was a high short-term mortality rate, despite predictions of a favorable outcome. We therefore believe these patients represent a subgroup of patients with alcoholic hepatitis and that the leukemoid reaction is a poor prognostic sign in this disease. ',\n",

As CT scanning has evolved as a reliable clinical tool, the use of angiography in the diagnosis of aortic aneurysmal disease has diminished. Fewer than 25% of patients with aortic aneurysmal disease undergo aortic angiographic evaluation at our institution. A prospective clinical study was undertaken to assess the validity of this policy. One hundred patients with clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of aortic aneurysms were evaluated prospectively during the period July 1987 to December 1989. All patients underwent CT scanning as an initial evaluation. Patients were selected for angiography if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: radiographic evidence of thoracoabdominal or juxtarenal aneurysms, or horseshoe kidney; or clinical suggestion of renal artery stenosis, mesenteric arterial insufficiency, aortoiliac occlusive disease, or lower extremity aneurysmal disease. During this period 19 patients (19%) underwent both CT scanning and angiography. The indications for angiography were thoracoabdominal aneurysms (7), juxtarenal aneurysms (2), clinical evidence of mesenteric insufficiency (1) or renal insufficiency (2), evidence of lower extremity aneurysmal disease (3), or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (4). Eighty-one patients (81%) underwent CT scanning as the only radiographic evaluation. No patient was adversely affected by elimination of angiographic evaluation. CT scanning revealed inflammatory aneurysms (4), retroaortic renal veins (2), and horseshoe kidney (1). This study suggests that most (81%) patients with aortic aneurysmal disease can be adequately evaluated by CT scanning, and that a very selective policy of angiographic evaluation is indicated.

Significant growth retardation was found in 115 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed their growth. These children were diagnosed before 12 years of age and treated on four protocols in a single institution; all received either cranial (n = 78) or craniospinal (n = 37) prophylactic irradiation. Patients' heights at diagnosis were within expected ranges, but final heights were greater than or equal to 1 SD below population means in 74% of cases and greater than or equal to 2 SD in 37%. Effects on growth were more pronounced for children who had received craniospinal irradiation, but decrements were also significant in the cranial irradiation group, with adult heights greater than or equal to 2 SD below population norms in 32%. Growth retardation was significantly greater (P less than .0001) in children who had earlier disease onset. Growth deceleration occurred not only during chemotherapy but during a later period that followed an interval of improved growth in many cases. Thus, late decrements in growth may be missed in studies that do not follow patients until they have attained final heights. These findings indicate that abnormally short stature among survivors of ALL merits further clinical and research attention. \",\n",

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to enhance healing of experimental gastric ulcers when given subcutaneously or orally in the drinking water. This effect of EGF occurs without reducing gastric acid secretion. On the other hand, EGF reportedly is excreted rapidly from gastric lumen when administered by intragastric bolus. This suggests that further stimulation of ulcer healing may be expected if EGF is given with an acid-suppressive agent or with an agent allowing EGF to remain in rat gastric lumen at high concentrations. In the present study, EGF administered by gastric intubation at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, which is three times smaller than reported in previous studies, was evaluated for its effect on acetic acid-induced rat gastric ulcers in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole. Sucralfate is well known selectively to bind proteins covering the ulcer base, and omeprazole is a potent acid-suppressive agent. Prior to the study of combined EGF and sucralfate, oral sucralfate was confirmed to allow endogenous gastric EGF and mouse EGF given exogenously to remain at high concentrations in gastric contents and tissues. EGF and sucralfate (2 g/kg/day) given alone failed to stimulate ulcer healing in submandibularectomized rats (SMR rat) whose endogenous gastric EGF was depleted. However, the combination of both drugs administered at the same doses significantly accelerated ulcer healing in the SMR rat. Omeprazole (200 mg/kg/day) significantly enhanced ulcer healing regardless of removal of the submandibular glands. The combination of EGF and omeprazole further stimulated ulcer healing in the SMR rat. ',\n",

In a retrospective study of 530 consecutive patients presenting to our unit as acute uraemic emergencies over a six-year period, 85 (16 per cent) had renovascular disease that was considered to be responsible for their loss of renal function. Twenty-one (4 per cent) patients had uraemia which could be clearly attributable to ACE inhibitor treatment; 18 of these cases were shown to have significant renovascular pathology. Following withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor the renal failure reversed in the majority of patients. We also examined 400 consecutive hypertensive patients referred over a similar period and, although vascular imaging was performed only when it was considered to be clinically indicated, 58 (14.5 per cent) of these patients were shown to have renovascular pathology. A further five patients with stable chronic renal disease were seen to have a deterioration in their glomerular filtration rate coincident with commencement of ACE inhibitor therapy; this reversed when the agents were withdrawn. These observations indicate that significant renovascular disease may be more common than has been hitherto recognized and that injudicious use of ACE inhibitors may result in serious complications. Methods which may minimize such iatrogenic disease are suggested. ',\n",

We have recently shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes human granulopoiesis, specifically augmenting basophilic cell differentiation observed in methylcellulose hematopoietic colony assays of human peripheral blood. Because the NGF effect was seen in the presence of conditioned medium derived from a human T-cell line (Mo-CM) containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we examined interactions of purified NGF and recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) on granulocyte growth and differentiation. rhGM-CSF stimulated a dose-dependent increase in methylcellulose colony growth at concentrations between 0.1 U/mL and 10 U/mL, and in the presence of NGF at 500 ng/mL this effect was enhanced. The number of basophilic cell colony-forming units (CFU-Baso) and histamine-positive colonies increased synergistically when NGF was added to rhGM-CSF. Furthermore, because Mo-CM acts with sodium butyrate to promote basophilic differentiation of alkaline-passaged myeloid leukemia cells, HL-60, we also examined the interaction of NGF and Mo-CM or rhGM-CSF using this assay. In the presence of NGF, Mo-CM at concentrations of 0.5% to 20% vol/vol, and rhGM-CSF at concentrations of 0.1 U/mL to 100 U/mL synergistically increased histamine production by butyrate-induced, alkaline-passaged HL-60 cells; this was associated with the appearance of metachromatic, tryptase-negative, IgE receptor-positive cells. The effects of rhGM-CSF or Mo-CM were completely abrogated by a specific anti-rhGM-CSF neutralizing antibody in methylcellulose, with or without NGF; the NGF synergy with rhGM-CSF in the HL-60 assay was also inhibited by either anti-rhGM-CSF or anti-NGF antibody. These studies support the notion that differentiation in the basophilic lineage may be enhanced by NGF acting to increase the number of GM-CSF-responsive basophilic cell progenitors. ',\n",

This study compares the metabolic and functional effects of three different models of ischemia in the immature heart. The intent was (1) to develop a model of energy-depleted and functionally depressed heart to be used in subsequent studies of myocardial protection and (2) to characterize the biochemical changes following different interventions. Forty-five minutes of normothermic global ischemia produced severe depletion of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate (greater than 70%) but was associated with 85% +/- 10% recovery of left ventricular function. Postischemic functional depression (less than 30% recovery) could be produced by either (1) extending the ischemic duration to 60 minutes or (2) preceding 45 minutes of ischemia by 60 minutes of hypoxic stress (oxygen tension 25 to 30 mm Hg). Neither of these more severe interventions caused more profound depletion of adenosine triphosphate or creatine phosphate, but hypoxic stress produced marked tissue depletion of glutamate (52%) and aspartate (48%) before aortic clamping. Longer ischemia or preceding hypoxia led to greater myocardial accumulation of lactate (greater than 250 versus 104 mumol/gm dry weight) and succinate (18 versus 11 mumol/gm dry weight) during aortic clamping, p less than 0.05 versus 45 minutes of ischemia) and greater postischemic depression and amino acid (greater than 65% aspartate depletion) and carbohydrate (greater than 50% glycogen depletion) metabolism, p less than 0.05 versus simple ischemia. These findings suggest that more severe ischemic/hypoxic models are needed in immature hearts to produce functional depression, and the biochemical analyses suggest the characteristics of metabolic defects that must be corrected to resuscitate these hearts during surgical correction of congenital defects.

Once the valve was crossed, the coronary catheter was replaced with a pigtail catheter for pressure and ventriculography.

The presence of meningeal involvement in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Conventional methods of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) leukemia rely on the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell morphology, which may produce ambiguous results in the presence of minimal leukemic involvement. A methodology has been developed for immunophenotyping small numbers of CSF cells while preserving cell morphology. CSF samples from 33 children with CD10 (common ALL antigen [CALLA]) positive ALL were examined at initial presentation using both conventional morphology and this combined immunohistopathologic technique. Six (18%) of the samples contained lymphoblasts or cells considered morphologically suspicious for leukemic involvement. Nine additional samples (27% of the total) had normal CSF morphology, but contained increased numbers of CALLA positive cells. Twelve of the 33 samples were also examined for the simultaneous presence of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and demonstrated increased numbers of cells positive for both TdT and CD10. These data suggest that a large proportion of children with ALL may have abnormalities of CSF cells at initial diagnosis consistent with the presence of occult leukemic involvement. ',\n",

To validate a recent proposal that a phospholipid lining with a high content of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine may protect gastric mucosa against luminal acid, it was decided to study composition and metabolism of phospholipids in the gastric mucosa. Phospholipids were analyzed in rat, human, and dog gastric mucosal surface tissue and in a chloroform/methanol-lavage of rat and canine stomach. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the main components. Saturated fatty acids were almost exclusively esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine, and unsaturated fatty acids mainly at the sn-2 position. The disaturated class of phosphatidylcholine comprised 2%-6% of total phosphatidylcholine. Precursors of phosphatidylcholine, i.e., [32P]orthophosphate and [methyl-14C]choline, were preferentially incorporated into the disaturated molecular class 0.5-6 hours after IV administration. It can be speculated that disaturated phosphatidylcholine, although quantitatively a minor component, is specifically triggered in mucosal renewal processes. ',\n",

The routine, archival paraffin wax embedded diagnostic blocks from these cases were also analysed. Nineteen (95%) of the tumours were shown to contain aneuploid stemlines by systematic sampling, but if only one of these systematic tissue blocks had been taken from each case the incidence of DNA aneuploidy could have been as low as 45%.

We suggest that typical acute hemorrhagic edema should be regarded as a separate clinical entity. This allows an appropriate prognosis to be made for this generally benign disease of infants. ',\n",
       " 695: 'Insulin-like growth factor-I receptors in human hyperplastic prostate tissue: characterization, tissue localization, and their modulation by chronic treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors were characterized in membranes obtained from prostate tissue of patients affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) before and after treatment with a GnRH agonist analog. Binding of [125I]IGF-I to membranes obtained from untreated patients was specific and time and temperature dependent. Analysis of the binding data yielded two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity (Kd, 10(-11) mol/L) and one of lower affinity (Kd, 10(-9) mol/L). BPH membrane preparations were affinity-cross linked to labeled IGF-I, and then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis by autoradiography revealed one labeled protein with an apparent Mr = 300K under nonreducing conditions and two labeled protein with Mr = 270K and Mr = 130K under reducing conditions. Excess unlabeled IGF-II reduce both of them, whereas the same excess of IGF-I completely abolished them. In membrane preparations of prostatic tissues from patients affected by BPH and treated for 2 months with a GnRH agonist analog, the binding capacities of both binding sites were significantly higher than those of BPH tissue from untreated patients, whereas binding affinities were unchanged. The IGF-I receptor in BPH prostate tissue of untreated patients was mainly localized in the basal layer of the epithelium, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining, whereas in the tissue from treated patients positive staining was found also in the glandular epithelium. These results demonstrate that: 1) specific binding sites for IGF-I are present in prostatic tissue from patients with BPH, 2) androgen deprivation increases their binding capacities and seems to modify their epithelial localization.

The peri-operative anaesthetic management of 11 patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing single-lung transplantation is presented. Intra-operative problems, the early postoperative phase of recovery and intensive care, and other incidents in which general anaesthesia was required for the management of complications, are featured. Results, both short- and long-term, are mentioned. Major intra-operative events that cause concern appear to be related to the severity of the presenting illness and the development of respiratory failure. Others have reported the development of intra-operative cardiac failure. All cases were successfully managed operatively using conventional one-lung anaesthesia, although resort to partial cardiopulmonary bypass may have been indicated in some.

       " 697: 'Nephron function in the early phase of ischemic renal failure. Significance of erythrocyte trapping. Trapping of red blood cells (RBCs) in renal medulla vasculature in postischemic acute renal failure (ARF) was found to depend upon the length of the ischemic period. Thus trapping occurred after 45 minutes but not 25 minutes of ischemia. By prior hemodilution to a hematocrit (hct) of 30%, RBC trapping after 45 minutes of ischemia could be completely prevented. Likewise hemo-concentration (hct = 60%) before 25 minutes of ischemia resulted in extensive RBC trapping. By increasing or decreasing the hct, the contribution of RBC trapping to the functional defects and decrease in renal blood flow that follows minor (25 min) and more substantial (45 min) ischemia was investigated. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured by microspheres, and vascular and tubular pressure by the micropuncture technique. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from inulin clearance, and tubular function from urine osmolality and sodium and potassium excretion. It was found that postischemic RBF was not correlated to RBC trapping but depended on the length of ischemia. After both 25 and 45 minutes of ischemia tubular obstructions occurred in the proximal tubules and/or loops of Henle, causing an increase in proximal tubular pressure. These obstructions were dependent on the length of ischemia but not on RBC trapping. After hemoconcentration and 25 minutes of ischemia there was an increment in distal tubular pressure, indicating that abundant RBC trapping may contribute to an increase in tubular pressure by compression of medullary tubules and thereby reduce GFR. When the damage was more severe other factors came into play and the contribution of RBC trapping to the decrease in GFR was minimal. ',\n",

Thirty-three patients had structural heart disease and none had an accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. The AV node effective and functional refractory periods, the shortest atrial pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 conduction, the AV node conduction time and indexes of concealed conduction in the AV node were measured in the baseline state (36 patients) and after modification of sympathetic tone by infusion of isoproterenol or propranolol (8 patients each). Atrial fibrillation was then induced with rapid atrial pacing, and the mean, shortest and longest ventricular cycle lengths were measured. Variables that correlated most strongly with the mean RR interval during atrial fibrillation were the AV node effective refractory period (r = 0.93; p less than 0.001), AV node functional refractory period (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001) and shortest atrial pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.91; p less than 0.001). The AH interval during sinus rhythm (r = 0.74; p less than 0.001) and during atrial pacing at the shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.52; p less than 0.001) had weaker correlations. Measures of concealed conduction did not improve the prediction of the mean or longest ventricular cycle length during atrial fibrillation. In conclusion, the refractory periods and conductivity of the AV node are the best indicators of the potential of the node to transmit atrial impulses to the ventricles during atrial fibrillation. The degree of concealed conduction in the AV node is a less important determinant of the mean ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. ',\n",

To assess the effect of nicardipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function independent of concurrent effects on loading conditions in patients with LV systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease, equihypotensive doses of intravenous nitroprusside and nicardipine were administered to 12 patients with congestive heart failure due to previous myocardial infarction (LV ejection fraction less than 0.40). LV micromanometer pressure and simultaneous radionuclide volume were obtained during a baseline period, during nitroprusside infusion, during a second baseline period and during nicardipine infusion. Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased an average of 21 mm Hg with nitroprusside and 19 mm Hg with nicardipine. A greater decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure was observed with nitroprusside (29 +/- 2 to 15 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than with nicardipine (29 +/- 2 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). There was a decrease in the time constant of relaxation during nitroprusside but not during nicardipine infusion. There was enough overlap in LV volumes in the baseline and nitroprusside periods to compare diastolic pressure-volume relations over a common range of volumes in 4 patients, and enough overlap in the baseline and nicardipine periods in 11 patients. The relation was shifted downward in 3 of 4 patients taking nitroprusside and in 6 of 11 patients taking nicardipine. The relation between end-diastolic pressure and volume was not shifted with nicardipine. ',\n",

Morphologic evaluation of bone marrow for neuroblastoma cells is a routine and important component of clinical staging. Specific immunostaining of malignant cells with monoclonal antibodies should be more sensitive, however, and may improve the detection of metastases and provide additional prognostic information. METHODS. We looked for tumor cells in bone marrow from 197 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma, using immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies (immunocytologic analysis) and examination of smears and specimens obtained by trephine biopsy (conventional analysis). RESULTS. Routine smears and trephine-biopsy specimens were positive for tumor cells in 46 percent of the patients, whereas 67 percent were positive on immunocytologic analysis (P less than 0.0001). Immunocytologic analysis detected bone marrow metastases in 34 percent of patients considered to have only localized or regional disease (Stage I, II, or III). It also identified tumor cells that were not detected by conventional analysis in patients with widespread disease (Stage IV or IVS). Tumor content, as determined by immunocytologic analysis, predicted clinical outcome in relation to the age of the patient at diagnosis. Patients with Stage II or III disease diagnosed after one year of age who did not have occult marrow metastases did well, whereas those with metastases did poorly (P = 0.006). Patients in whom Stage IV disease was diagnosed before they were one year of age did well if bone marrow metastases were few or absent, but had poor survival if the marrow contained more than 0.02 percent tumor cells (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS. Immunocytologic analysis of bone marrow aspirates is more sensitive than conventional analysis in detecting tumor cells and provides prognostic information. The relations among marrow metastases, age at diagnosis, and clinical outcome illustrate the biologic heterogeneity of neuroblastoma. ',\n",

This study examined the implications of left ventricular (LV) dilatation and increased pulmonary thallium uptake during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia. The lung-to-heart thallium ratio in the initial images was significantly higher in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than normal subjects; 0.48 +/- 0.16 in 3-vessel disease (n = 16), 0.43 +/- 0.10 in 2-vessel disease (n = 20), 0.43 +/- 0.08 in 1-vessel disease (n = 16) and 0.36 +/- 0.05 in normal subjects (n = 7) (p less than 0.001, 0.09 and 0.06, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the severity and the extent of the perfusion abnormality (determined from the polar maps) and the lung-to-heart thallium ratio (r = 0.51 and 0.52, respectively, p less than 0.0002). There was also a significant correlation between lung thallium washout and lung-to-heart thallium ratio (r = 0.42, p = 0.0009) and peak heart rate (r = -0.49, p less than 0.0001). The LV dilatation was mostly due to an increase in cavity dimension (30% increase) and to a lesser extent (6% increase) due to increase in LV size. (The cavity dimensions were measured from the short-axis slices at the midventricular level in the initial and delayed images). The dilation was seen in patients with CAD but not in the normal subjects. These changes correlated with the extent and severity of the thallium perfusion abnormality. Thus, adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia may cause LV dilation and increased lung thallium uptake on the basis of subendocardial ischemia. ',\n",

The most effective agent, BCNU (carmustine), has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum. To obviate these problems, a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. In this Phase I-II study, 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant. Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively, upon completion of tumor debulking. The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks. Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels. There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself. The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group, 64 weeks for the second dose group, and 32 weeks for the highest dose group. The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation. The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer. Frequent hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy. Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe, a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started. The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma. ',\n",
       " 703: 'Mechanism of glucoregulatory responses to stress and their deficiency in diabetes. During exercise, increased energy demands are met by increased glucose production that occurs simultaneously with the increased glucose uptake. We had previously observed that, during exercise, metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCR) increases markedly in normal, but only marginally in poorly controlled diabetic dogs. We wished to determine (i) whether in a more general model of stress matched increases in rate of appearance of glucose and MCR also occur, or if MCR is suppressed, as during catecholamine infusion; and (ii) whether diabetes affects stress-induced changes in rate of glucose appearance and MCR. Therefore, we injected carbachol (27 nmol/50 microliters), an analog of acetylcholine, intracerebroventricularly in seven conscious dogs before and after induction of alloxan diabetes. In normal dogs, plasma epinephrine and cortisol increased 4- to 5-fold, whereas norepinephrine and glucagon doubled. Plasma insulin, however, remained unchanged. Tracer-determined hepatic glucose production increased rapidly, but transiently, by 2.5-fold. This increment can be fully explained by the observed increments in the counterregulatory hormones. Surprisingly, however, MCR also promptly increased, and therefore, plasma glucose changed only marginally. After induction of diabetes, the animals were given intracerebroventricular carbachol while plasma glucose was maintained at moderate hyperglycemia (9.0 +/- 0.4 mM). Increments in counterregulatory hormones were similar to those seen in normal dogs, except for exaggerated norepinephrine release. Peripheral insulin levels were higher in diabetic than in normal dogs; however, MCR was markedly reduced and the lipolytic response to stress increased, indicating insulin resistance. Interestingly, the hyperglycemic response to stress was 6-fold greater in diabetic than normal animals, relating mainly to the failure of MCR to rise. Plasma lactate increased equivalently in diabetic and normal animals despite suppression of MCR in the diabetics, indicating either greater muscle glycogenolysis and/or impairment in glucose oxidation. We conclude that in this stress model MCR increases as in exercise in normal but not in diabetic dogs. We speculate that glucose uptake in stress could be mediated through an insulin-dependent neural mechanism. ',\n",

Preoperative ultrasonography, inspection and palpation identified 238 metastases in 42 patients. Intraoperative ultrasonography detected 116 previously unrecognized metastatic tumours during 40 surgical procedures (P less than 0.01).

We reviewed our 115-month experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) in adult and pediatric patients to determine whether there is a difference in the incidence of peritonitis between patients performing CAPD or CCPD. Peritonitis rates were similar in patients performing CAPD or CCPD in both the adult and pediatric age groups. The overall CAPD peritonitis rate was significantly lower in adult patients when compared with pediatric patients. There was no difference in peritonitis rates for CCPD between adult and pediatric patients. When the data are divided into 3-year subgroups, the incidence of peritonitis is significantly lower in adult patients undergoing either CAPD or CCPD when compared with pediatric patients during the years 1986 to 1988. There is significant improvement over time in the incidence of peritonitis in both adult and pediatric patients performing CCPD; similarly, there is a trend toward improvement in patients performing CAPD. Staphylococcus species organisms remain the most common bacterial cause of peritonitis, except in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years or with nephrostomies, where gram-negative rod infections were more common. Peritonitis resulted in discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis in a greater number of adult patients. These results suggest that the number of catheter manipulations is not important in determining the incidence of peritonitis. Pediatric patients are more likely than adult patients to develop peritonitis with either CAPD or CCPD. Adult patients are more likely than pediatric patients to discontinue peritoneal dialysis secondary to peritonitis. ',\n",

Primary pulmonary hypertension is a clinical syndrome characterized by pulmonary hypertension in the absence of sufficient underlying cardiac, parenchymal pulmonary, or systemic disease to account for it. The population of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension is a heterogeneous one, both clinically and histologically. As the etiologic mechanisms are unknown, therapy is directed toward the consequences of the pulmonary vascular process. Oxygen supplementation, the use of digoxin and diuretics for symptomatic heart failure, and anticoagulation all may have a role in treating primary pulmonary hypertension, although vasodilator therapy has been the main area of investigation. Screening for vasodilator responsiveness, defining a favorable vasodilator effect, predicting long-term effectiveness, and deciding who to treat have all been controversial. New approaches, such as use of high-dose calcium channel-blocking agents and continuous intravenous infusion of prostacyclin (an investigational agent), have recently been proposed.

Similarly, the ratio of peak velocity in the branch/main PA was greater for the PPS group: right/main PA peak velocity = 2.91 vs 1.92, p less than 0.01, and left/main PA peak velocity = 2.73 vs 1.99, p less than 0.05. The calculated right ventricular output for the PPS group was more than the control group: 437 vs 261 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001. Hematocrits were not done on the control group, but the PPS group had an average hematocrit which was low (34%). It is concluded that patients with PPS have mild underdevelopment of the PA branches, with consequent increased flow velocity and turbulent flow. This turbulent flow may be contributed to by increased cardiac output and mild anemia. ',\n",

Preoperative serum prostate specific antigen correlates well with morphometrically determined prostate tumor volume in prostatectomy specimens. However, since prostate specific antigen is produced by hyperplastic as well as malignant prostatic epithelium, the contribution of hyperplastic epithelium (benign prostatic hyperplasia) to serum prostate specific antigen interferes with the ability of serum prostate specific antigen to predict tumor volume in individual patients. We wondered if the removal of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue would increase the correlation between prostate specific antigen and tumor volume, and, thus, make prostate specific antigen a more accurate predictor of residual cancer volume after transurethral resection of the prostate. A total of 67 patients with clinical stage A cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (22, or 33%, with stage A1 and 45, or 67%, with stage A2 disease), and had pre-radical prostatectomy measurement of serum prostate specific antigen and morphometric determination of residual cancer volume in the radical prostatectomy specimen. The correlation between serum prostate specific antigen and residual cancer volume for all 67 patients was 0.66, and for stages A1 and A2 disease it was 0.64 and 0.70, respectively. All stage A1 cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of 1 ng./ml. or less had residual tumor volumes of less than 0.5 cc and all stage A cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of more than 10 ng./ml. had residual tumor volumes of greater than 0.5 cc. Of the patients 51% had levels of 1 to 10 ng./ml. and serum prostate specific antigen was not useful to predict residual tumor volume in this group.

This interaction has physiologic consequences and appears to be able to regulate such local events as chloride ion secretion by epithelial cells of the intestinal and respiratory tracts in experimental models. In this way, the mast cell and nerve may be considered as a functional homeostatic regulatory unit. The extent to which this unit may be involved in maintenance of normal integrity of mucous membranes or other structures, in health and in disease, is not clear at the present and will require considerably more investigation and elucidation. However, the concept of such an interaction is an interesting one and may bring new approaches of a therapeutic and diagnostic nature to bear on some old problems.

We found that both sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide strongly inhibited growth of BON, PT-2, and PT-SM cells. With continuous exposure of BON cells to sodium butyrate (2 mmol/L), the doubling time was prolonged, from 60 hours in controls to 156 hours, and saturation density was reduced to 28% that of controls. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (4 mmol/L) reduced saturation density to 37% that of controls in BON cells and prolonged the doubling time, from 60 hours to 103 hours. Antiproliferative effects of similar magnitudes were observed in the gastrinoma cell lines. In contrast, differential effects were produced on amine biosynthesis in BON cells; sodium butyrate stimulated levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the cells, whereas hexamethylene bisacetamide caused a profound dose-dependent inhibition of amine biosynthesis. The significant antiproliferative activity of sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide and the inhibitory effects of hexamethylene bisacetamide on amine biosynthesis warrant evaluation of these agents or analogues for treatment of metastatic carcinoid and gastrinoma.

Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) has recently been linked to locus D3S47 (probe C17), with no recombination, in a single large Irish family. Other ADRP pedigrees have shown linkage at zero recombination, linkage with recombination, and no linkage, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity. The gene encoding rhodopsin, the rod photoreceptor pigment, is closely linked to locus D3S47 on chromosome 3q. A point mutation changing a conserved proline to histidine in the 23d codon of the gene has been demonstrated in affected members of one ADRP family and in 17 of 148 unrelated ADRP patients. We have sequenced the rhodopsin gene in a C17-linked ADRP family and have identified in the 4th exon and in-frame 3-bp deletion which deletes one of the two isoleucine monomers at codons 255 and 256. This mutation was not found in 30 other unrelated ADRP families. The deletion has arisen in the sequence TCATCATCAT, deleting one of a run of three x 3-bp repeats. The mechanism by which this occurred may be similar to that which creates length variation in so-called mini- and microsatellites.

Over one year, 254 consecutive patients who consulted their GP for chronic abdominal pain were asked to answer a guided questionnaire. A checklist of simple parameters suggestive of the presence of organic diseases of the colon was also registered by the GP. For the final diagnosis, the patients underwent either a colonoscopy or a barium enema. Data collected were analysed by means of a stepwise logistic regression analysis to obtain a weighted score for the diagnosis of either irritable bowel syndrome (score less than 0) or organic disease (score greater than 0).

We carried out coronary arteriography on fifteen hypertensive patients with LVH and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 3 consecutive ventricular complexes) of whom nine (60%) were free of significant (greater than 50% stenosis) coronary disease. To identify other possible correlates of left ventricular arrhythmias, 28 patients with LVH, comprising 17 with ventricular tachycardia and 11 without ventricular arrhythmias, underwent quantitative assessment of left ventricular function (angiographic ejection fraction), left ventricular mass (echocardiography), and left ventricular fibrosis (endomyocardial biopsy). Ejection fraction was not significantly different between the two groups (53 +/- 8% v 62 +/- 2%, P = NS). However, left ventricular mass was significantly greater (442 +/- 28 g v 339 +/- 34 g, P less than .05) and percentage fibrosis significantly higher (19 +/- 4% v 3 +/- 1%, P less than .001) in those patients with ventricular tachycardia.

In five rabbits (15%), a stenosis of more than 50% of luminal area was due to intimal proliferation of SMCs, and in four other rabbits, a total occlusion was due to organized thrombi. After the initial ablation of the performed plaque (13 +/- 6 intimal SMC layers) a continuous increase of intimal wall thickness was found from 7 +/- 6 SMC layers at 7 days to 28 +/- 5 intimal SMC layers at 28 days after excimer laser ablation (p less than 0.01). After 42 days, no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred. After bromodeoxyuridine labeling, the extent of cell proliferation (percent of cells undergoing DNA synthesis) in the intima and media was determined using a monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine. Immunohistological quantification of SMC proliferation in the intima revealed a significant increase of cells undergoing DNA synthesis at 3 (p less than 0.05) and 14 (p less than 0.01) days after laser treatment. Medial proliferation of SMCs was delayed and had a significant increase 7 days (p less than 0.05) after intervention. Twenty-one days after laser treatment, SMC proliferation in the intima as well as in the media was normalized. CONCLUSIONS. The proliferative response of SMCs after experimental excimer laser treatment will occur as a dynamic process with a maximum of SMCs undergoing DNA synthesis during 14 days after laser ablation, resulting in an increase of intimal thickening within 4 weeks after laser treatment. The extent of intimal hyperplasia due to SMC proliferation after excimer laser treatment is comparable with the effect of transluminal balloon angioplasty in this experimental model. ',\n",
       " 719: 'Endothelium-derived relaxing factors. A perspective from in vivo data. We review below published studies of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in vivo. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been demonstrated in conduit arteries in vivo and in the cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, and femoral vascular beds as well as in the microcirculation of the brain and the microcirculation of cremaster muscle. The available evidence, although not complete, strongly suggests that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by acetylcholine in the cerebral microcirculation is a nitrosothiol. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by bradykinin in this vascular bed is an oxygen radical generated in association with enhanced arachidonate metabolism via cyclooxygenase. In the microcirculation of skeletal muscle, on the other hand, the vasodilation from bradykinin is mediated partly by prostacyclin and partly by an endothelium-derived relaxing factor similar to that generated by acetylcholine. Basal secretion of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is controversial in vivo but is usually present in vitro. On the other hand, it appears that endothelium-derived relaxing factor mediates flow-dependent vasodilation in both large vessels and in the microcirculation in vivo. The generation and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from endothelium may be abnormal in a variety of conditions including acute and chronic hypertension, atherosclerosis, and ischemia followed by reperfusion. Several mechanisms for these abnormalities have been identified. These include inability to generate endothelium-derived relaxing factor or destruction of endothelium-derived relaxing factor by oxidants after its release in the extracellular space. These abnormalities in endothelium-dependent relaxation may contribute to the vascular abnormalities in these conditions. ',\n",

Six hundred and seventy one patients (52.5% women) with Crohn's disease seen at Leiden University Hospital between 1934 and 1984 were identified. Follow up was 98.2% complete. Sixty four (9.7%) of the 659 patients died. The cause of death was related to Crohn's disease in 34 patients, probably related to the disease in four, and unrelated, from incidental causes, in 25. The cause of death could not be identified in one patient. There was a significant decrease of deaths related to the disease after 1973. Causes of death such as amyloidosis and malnutrition have disappeared and postoperative deaths have decreased. The standardised mortality ratio showed an excess mortality of 2.23 for all patients. It was higher for women (3.30) than for men (1.76). A comparison of two recent 10 year periods showed a significant decrease in standardised mortality ratio in men but not in women. Patients whose disease started before the age of 20 years had an excess mortality compared with older patients. This study supports the view that the prognosis of Crohn's disease has improved in general but high quality medical and surgical management is important particularly for younger patients. \",\n",

Mortality rates of approximately 10-30% and amputation rates of the same magnitude in the survivors are repeatedly reported despite advances in medical and surgical techniques. Our experience, which utilized percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolysis as the initial treatment in 72 instances (63 patients), has resulted in a markedly lower mortality rate of 1.6% and a lower amputation rate of 8.5% in the survivors. Careful categorization by clinical degree of ischemia indicates that 82% of the cases were either threatened or irreversible limb ischemia. The initial treatment with thrombolysis did not preclude subsequent prompt surgical treatment when necessary; in these cases, thrombolysis promoted improved surgical results (100%) when it was successful. It markedly reduced the need for urgent surgery, usually simplified the subsequent surgical approach, diminished the overall need for surgery, and often accomplished a successful outcome alone (31%). Significant bleeding was not noted during subsequent surgical procedures and was noted in only 2.8% of the cases. Confirmation of these results and further improvements in technique might justify the use of an initially high-dose urokinase transcatheter infusion regimen as the initial treatment of choice for acute lower-limb ischemia.

Potential prognostic anatomic and hemodynamic factors were evaluated in 248 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), all treated by direct microsurgical removal. The size of each AVM was calculated by its volume, obtained by the multiplication of the three AVM diameters by 0.52. A surgical classification of AVM location (in 11 groups) is proposed. Types of feeders and of drainage were classified as superficial or deep; the extent of the drainage system was classified according to a four-degree scale. The mean flow velocity in the main AVM feeder, detected using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, was used as an indirect measure of AVM shunt flow in a small number of patients (n = 29). AVM volume was a very important prognostic factor: the incidence of hyperemic complications and the morbidity and mortality rate were significantly higher when the volume of the lesion was greater than 20 cm3 (P less than 0.0001 for hyperemic complications; P less than 0.001 for permanent morbidity and mortality). The incidence of hyperemic complications and the morbidity rate were higher in AVMs in rolandic, inferior limbic, and insular locations than in AVMs in other locations. As for other anatomic factors: a) the presence of deep feeders significantly increased the incidence of hyperemic complications, as well as the morbidity and mortality rate; b) the presence of deep drainage significantly increased permanent morbidity only; c) the extension of the venous system was significantly related to the development of hyperemic complications, and to morbidity and mortality. Transcranial Doppler examination showed that mean flow velocities greater than 120 cm/s in the main feeder were associated with a significantly higher rate of postoperative hematomas and transient deficits. A classification of cerebral AVMs that takes into account AVM volume and location, the type of feeders, the extent of the drainage system, and the main feeder flow velocity is suggested. ',\n",

To date, it has not been reported antenatally. A 16-year-old pregnant adolescent had an ultrasonogram at 25 weeks of pregnancy that revealed ascites in the fetus. After the infant was delivered at 32 weeks, a hepato-iminodiacetic acid scan showed a spontaneous rupture of the common bile duct. The infant was treated with external drainage of the biliary tree and recovered well. This case demonstrates that spontaneous perforations of the bile ducts can occur much earlier than the usually described 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be diagnosed antenatally, and should be added to the list of causes of fetal ascites.

In 1988, 5 patients (3 men and 2 women) with ulcer disease (mean age 56 +/- 8 years) underwent valvular replacement for aortic (No. = 4) or mitral disease (No. = 1). All patients had had gastroduodenal ulcers. Preoperative gastroscopy demonstrated active ulcers (No. = 4) and a healed pyloric ulcer with pyloric stenosis (No. = 1). Despite the presence of ulcers, a non-biologic prosthesis was preferred in each patient because of their young age (No. = 3), chronic atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy (No. = 1), and refusal of the eventuality of subsequent reoperation (No. = 1). In each patient, a truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty was performed simultaneously with the valvular procedures by the same incision. The postoperative courses were uneventful. With a mean follow-up of 15 +/- 3 months, no gastrointestinal bleeding was observed during anticoagulant therapy. With anticoagulant drugs, bleeding may occur with a frequency of 4% per patient treatment-year, half of which are gastrointestinal in origin. Nevertheless, in selected patients with gastroduodenal ulcers, performing a vagotomy-pyloroplasty simultaneously with valvular replacement allows implantation of a non-biologic prosthesis, with greater durability than bioprosthesis.

A suction drain was placed on each patient's right operative wound, while no drains were used on the left. Otherwise, the same operative technique and method of closure were used in all wounds. Statistical analysis of the results showed no difference between the two sides with regard to the incidences of swelling or persistent drainage. Return of active function of the quadriceps and of range of motion of the knee in patients who had had a total knee replacement was also unaffected by the use of suction drains. We concluded that the routine use of suction drains for wounds is unnecessary after uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty. \",\n",

The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific regions of the human genome in tumor DNA is recognized as evidence for a tumor-suppressor gene located within the corresponding region of the homologous chromosome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a panel of primary human breast tumor DNAs has led to the identification of two additional regions on chromosomes 17q and 18q that frequently are affected by LOH. Deletions of each of these regions have a significant correlation with clinical parameters that are associated with aggressive breast carcinomas. Previous restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of this panel of tumors has uncovered several other frequently occurring mutations. LOH on chromosome 18q frequently occurs in tumors with concomitant LOH of loci on chromosomes 17p and 11p. Similarly, tumors having LOH on 17q also have LOH on chromosomes 1p and 3p. This suggests that certain combinations of mutations may collaborate in the development and malignant progression of breast carcinomas. ',\n",

The relationship between the dose of ACTH and long-term prognosis was investigated in 29 patients. There was no relationship between the daily or total ACTH dosage, provided the dose was greater than 0.015 mg (0.6 IU)/kg/day, and the outcome of seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities; however, ACTH 0.04-0.06 mg (1.6-2.4 IU)/kg/day and a total ACTH dose of 1.1-1.5 mg (44-60 IU)/kg resulted in better mental development than smaller doses of ACTH.

Size and topography of the cortical tubers were analyzed on axial and coronal views, in T2 sequences, and the large tubers greater than 10 mm were studied. In addition, EEG follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients (76%) had both MRI large cortical tubers and EEG foci, 3 had normal EEG, 2 had normal MRI, and the remaining 3 had only small tubers. The number of large tubers was significantly related to EEG foci. A topographic MRI/EEG correspondence was observed for at least one tuber in 25 of the 26 patients, and correspondence was complete in 10 patients. Large cortical tubers without corresponding EEG foci were observed in 11 patients; these tubers mainly involved the frontal regions and were found before the patients were 2 years old. EEG foci without corresponding tubers were observed in 4 patients. In addition, secondary bilateral synchrony was preferentially observed in patients with frontal lesions and after the age of 2 years.

At the age of 5 years he developed visual impairment, tremor, ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, external ophthalmoplegia, and a pigmentary retinopathy (Kearns-Sayre syndrome). Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. Analysis of mtDNA from leukocytes and muscle showed mtDNA heteroplasmy in both tissues, with one population of mtDNA deleted by 4.9 kb. The deleted region was bridged by a 13-nucleotide sequence occurring as a direct repeat in normal mtDNA. Both Pearson syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome have been noted to be associated with deletions of mtDNA; they have not previously been described in the same patient. These observations indicate that the two disorders have the same molecular basis; the different phenotypes are probably determined by the initial proportion of deleted mtDNAs and modified by selection against them in different tissues.

The study included morphometry and DNA image analysis using the CAS-200 system. The most common presentation was urinary outlet obstruction (n = 9), and most patients were clinical Stage B with palpable prostatic lesions (n = 12). Compared with acinar cancers of similar clinical stage, duct cancers were large (tumor volume, 8.4 +/- 10.0 cc) and occupied a large portion of the gland (23 +/- 21%). Duct cancers were in an advanced final pathologic stage with 93% having capsular penetration, 47% positive margins, 40% seminal vesicle invasion, and 27% positive pelvic lymph nodes. The DNA analysis on cells disaggregated from paraffin revealed that 54% of cases were diploid, 15% tetraploid, 8% aneuploid, and 23% tetraploid/aneuploid. On clinical follow-up, eight patients had no evidence of tumor at intervals ranging from 1 to 28 months, and seven patients (47%) had persistent tumor at intervals of 3 to 18 months. This study demonstrates that duct cancers are in an advanced pathologic stage by the time of presentation and have a much higher short-term failure rate after radical prostatectomy compared with acinar cancers.

Fifteen abdominal organ systems and 17 physiologic variables in 300 consecutive patients were analyzed to determine ability to predict intraabdominal sepsis. There were no significant differences in predictive ability between the old and new organ risk factors. The addition of physiologic factors did not enhance the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. This clinical study demonstrates that: 1) the risk of intra-abdominal sepsis increases with increasing ATI score; 2) the previous (1979-initial) organ risk grading concept is statistically valid; 3) six of the 15 organ systems warrant a change in their relative rank order (1989-revision); 4) the addition of demographic, physiologic, and immunologic variables did not significantly improve the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis.

In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) nicardipine was compared with placebo in the control of postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. One hundred twenty-two patients (17 cardiac and 105 noncardiac surgery) met the entry criteria (systolic BP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) and were randomized (3:2) to receive IV nicardipine (n = 71) or placebo (n = 51). Therapeutic response (greater than or equal to 15 percent reduction in BP from baseline) was achieved in 94 percent of patients treated with IV nicardipine vs 12 percent with placebo (p less than 0.001). The mean response time and infusion rate for IV nicardipine were 11.5 (+/- 0.8) minutes and 12.8 (+/- 0.3) mg/h, respectively. The magnitude of BP reduction was similar in both cardiac and noncardiac postsurgical patients. Blood pressure control was sustained with minimal dose adjustments of IV nicardipine (3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/h) during a prolonged maintenance infusion period of 6.8 +/- 0.5 h. A reflex mean increase in heart rate of 5 bpm was seen in patients treated with IV nicardipine. Sixteen patients (15 noncardiac and one cardiac surgery) had a sustained heart rate of greater than 100 bpm, with a mean increase of 24 bpm from the baseline. In all these patients except three, tachycardia was resolved while receiving nicardipine. None of these patients who had development of tachycardia during nicardipine therapy had exhibited ST segment changes indicative of ischemia. One patient with tachycardia at baseline had exhibited ST segment depression (3 to 4 mm) during nicardipine treatment, which was resolved following discontinuation of nicardipine therapy and application of nitroglycerin (Nitropaste). Hemodynamic evaluation revealed that IV nicardipine significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and significantly increased cardiac index with no change in heart rate. These hemodynamic changes were similar in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. Adverse experiences reported with IV nicardipine included hypotension (4.5 percent), tachycardia (2.7 percent), and nausea/vomiting (4.5 percent). In the placebo group, the incidence of adverse experience was 6 percent, with an equal distribution of hypotension (2 percent), nausea/vomiting (2 percent), and headache (2 percent). No clinically important changes in laboratory variables related to IV nicardipine were reported. In conclusion, these findings indicate that nicardipine, a titratable intravenous calcium channel blocker, can rapidly and effectively control postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients.

Alkaline reflux gastritis and the symptoms associated with alkaline reflux gastritis have been reported in the medical literature since shortly after Billroth successfully performed his first gastrectomy in the 1880s. The disease process is produced by, or at least is associated with, the reflux of alkaline secretions into the gastric remnant. Although it occurs after any procedure that ablates the pylorus including pyloroplasty, it would appear to be most common after a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. How the alkaline secretions cause the gastritis is still controversial. Clearly, the most effective therapy is to reroute the secretions from the biliary tract, pancreas, and duodenum so that they will not reflux into the gastric remnant. This is most effectively accomplished by a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with the afferent limb measuring at least 18 inches (40 cm). The surgeon and the patient should be aware that the construction of such a gastric outlet channel is associated with delayed gastric emptying. The etiology of this impaired emptying is also controversial. If the patient has symptoms of dumping (either early or late), these symptoms may also be abated using the Roux limb. At least 40% of patients will have gastric outlet obstruction. Supportive therapy is appropriate in the majority of these patients. ',\n",

The authors used retrospective quantitative DNA analysis to study interrelationships between multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas in seven patients. DNA content was determined by image analysis on Feulgen-stained nuclear smears prepared from multiple paraffin blocks from each tumor. Tumors were unilateral in four cases and bilateral in three. Ten tumors had homogeneous, and four heterogeneous DNA stemlines. Intertumoral heterogeneity in four cases suggested multifocal origin. Identical DNA aneuploid indices in bilateral tumors in one case suggested metastasis from a solitary origin. Abnormal DNA content and heterogeneous populations began to appear in the size range 2.0 to 5.0 cm. All tumors over 5.0 cm contained nondiploid populations.

The smallest deletion (patient LGL1134) comprises approximately 45 kb of DNA, whereas the largest ones (patients 25.6 and LGL2905) span a DNA segment of at least 5 megabases, which is comparable in size to the smallest deletion detected in a TCD patient (patient XL45) showing a complex phenotype.

From March 1988 through June 1989, 70 women had two consecutive smears reported as IA; all underwent colposcopy and cervical biopsy. In 58 patients (83%) the biopsies and smears obtained during colposcopy were negative for condyloma and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Ten patients (14%) had condylomas, and two (3%) had condylomas with CIN (one CIN I and one II). The initial IA smears from those 12 patients were reviewed retrospectively: 2 showed condylomas (they had been undercalled), 5 were \"suggestive of condyloma\" (the atypical cells were too few or poorly preserved for a definitive diagnosis), and 5 showed IA.

Balloon valvuloplasty could not be successfully accomplished in any of the three infants presenting before 1989. Since March 1989, when improved catheter technology became available, all five neonates presenting with critical aortic stenosis were treated successfully by balloon valvuloplasty. A transumbilical approach was utilized in all four infants in whom umbilical artery access could be obtained. One newborn who was 25 days of age underwent transfemoral balloon valvuloplasty. Balloon valvuloplasty was immediately successful in all five newborns, as evidenced by a decrease in valve gradient and improvement in left ventricular function and cardiac output. Peak systolic gradient was reduced by 64% from 69 +/- 8 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg (p = 0.005). Left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 128 +/- 9 to 95 +/- 9 mm Hg (p = 0.02) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 20 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p = 0.02).

Observations presented suggest that the interchange of the Mg++ ion between the cerebrospinal fluid, extracellular fluid, and bone is more rapid and dynamic than is usually believed. This is especially so when the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is associated with significant skeletal depletion of Mg++ as judged by history rather than serum level. Magnesium, much like calcium, has a large presence in bone and has a negative feedback relationship with the parathyroid gland. A decline in central nervous system Mg++ may occur when the skeletal buffer system orchestrated largely by the parathyroid glands is activated by an increase in serum calcium. Observations in veterinary medicine and obstetrics suggest that the transfer of Mg++ from the extracellular fluid into bone during mineralization processes may be extensive. If the inhibition of the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is prolonged and the skeletal depletion of Mg++ extreme, serious neurologic symptoms, including seizures, coma, and death, may occur. Noise, excitement, and bodily contact appear to precipitate neurologic symptoms in Mg+(+)-deficient human subjects as it has been documented to occur in Mg+(+)-deficient experimental animals.

The potential deleterious effects of aerosolized fibrin on contaminated procedures were investigated in a rat model of peritonitis. One hundred forty rats were divided into two groups. In the control group, gelatin capsules containing feces (10(7) bacteria per milliliter) and barium sulfate at various dilutions were placed into the abdomen; in the second experimental group, a solution of cryoprecipitate, thrombin, and calcium was sprayed diffusely into the peritoneal cavity after similar fecal contamination. Fecal inocula with low bacterial concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 0.15 mL) caused few deaths from peritonitis or abscess formation in either group. Heavy peritoneal contamination (0.25, 0.3, and 0.5 mL) caused early deaths from peritonitis in both groups, with 80% of the deaths due to sepsis in the first 48 hours. However, in the moderately contaminated rats (0.2 mL of fecal inoculate), fibrin aerosol reduced the 10-day mortality from 80% to 10%. In all survivors in the fibrin-treated group, intraperitoneal abscesses developed. With intraperitoneal bacterial concentrations of 2 x 10(6) organisms, early acute mortality from fibrinopurulent peritonitis is decreased at the expense of late, localized, nonlethal abscess formation. Aerosolized fibrin solution must be used with caution in contaminated surgery. ',\n",

Hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium has been considered beyond the reach of resection. These patients usually die within a short period because of pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or cancer progression. The only treatment is hepatic resection with removal of the tumor thrombus. A 38-year-old woman underwent left lobectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient had an uneventful course and is doing well 15 months after surgery, without signs of recurrence. We have proved that hepatic resection with removal of a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium can be carried out successfully. The next problem is whether the lives of these patients can be prolonged by this operation. ',\n",

Thirty-six high-risk patients at the University of South Florida-affiliated hospitals received small-diameter shunts because of bleeding esophagogastric varices over a recent 2-year period. Portal vein and portal vein-inferior vena cava gradients were significantly reduced after shunting. These pressure changes were manifested clinically by the absence of variceal rebleeding and improvement of ascites; in addition, the incidence of encephalopathy was low. The 8-mm graft maintained hepatopedal flow in 67% of the patients, but reversal of flow did not result in complications commonly associated with poor portal perfusion. Graft thrombosis occurred in four (11%) patients. All grafts were successfully revised, three by operative revision and one by an interventional radiologist. Operative mortality was low (11%), and morbidity was unusual. The small-diameter H-graft portacaval shunt is a safe and effective method of treatment for bleeding esophagogastric varices. ',\n",

During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, all patients became HBsAg negative after transplantation but circulating HBsAg reappeared in 25 (22.7%). Overall 1-year survival was 83.6% and overall 2 year actuarial recurrence of HBsAg was 29% (59% after posthepatitis B cirrhosis, 13% after posthepatitis B-delta cirrhosis, and 0% after fulminant hepatitis B). Patients with HBV cirrhosis who were HBV-DNA positive had a much greater risk of HBsAg recurrence than patients who were HBV-DNA negative (96% vs 29% at 2 years). Reappearance of HBsAg was associated with evidence of HBV replication and abnormal histological findings in the graft.

No patient showed neurologic deterioration after surgery. In all patients, bony union occurred. Loss of reduction of more than 5 degrees occurred in 41% of the patients. Because of this high rate of loss of reduction in patients and the low degree of flexion-bending loading and torsional stability in biomechanical evaluation in vitro of the Slot-Zielke device on human cadaveric spines, an additional posterior stabilization of the spine after an anterior approach for anterior- and middle-column fractures should be considered.

The study objective was to determine what effect the replacement of bleomycin with VP-16 has on complete response (CR), survival, and drug toxicity. One hundred sixty-nine patients were registered and randomized. Of these patients, 160 were assessable for response. All had histologically confirmed disseminated germ cell neoplasms of testicular origin. Forty-six had minimal metastatic disease, and 114 had maximal disease. Seventy-seven were randomized to PVB and 83 to VPV chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in pretreatment characteristics between the two arms with regard to tumor burden, histologic type, and overall performance status. Patients received four courses of induction chemotherapy, either PVB (cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, vinblastine 12 mg/m2 day 1, bleomycin 15 U/m2 twice per week) or VPV (vinblastine 8 mg/m2 day 1, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, VP-16 50 mg/m2 days 2 to 5). Chemotherapy was given every 3 weeks. Cytoreductive surgery was done postinduction if a chemotherapy CR was not achieved. There was no difference in the percentage of patients achieving a disease-free status between PVB (77%) and VPV (73%). The mean leukocyte nadir was similar for both treatments, but the mean platelet nadir was significantly lower (P = .003) in the VPV arm. All bleomycin-related toxicities (pulmonary, mucositis, skin) were avoided in the VPV arm. We conclude that bleomycin can be replaced in first-line therapy for advanced germ cell tumors without sacrificing efficacy and with the advantage of avoiding unnecessary drug toxicity. ',\n",

The simultaneous infusion of tauroursodeoxycholate and taurochenodeoxycholate (0.6 and 0.4 mumol.min-1.100 gm-1, respectively) for 2 hr prevented the marked biochemical changes in the bile induced by taurochenodeoxycholate for 15 to 60 min exhibited significantly more necrotic hepatocytes, especially in zone 1, in comparison with animals infused with tauroursodeoxycholate or a combination of taurochenodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate.

The prevalence and characteristics of transient myocardial ischaemia were studied in 203 patients with recent acute myocardial infarction by both early (6.4 days) and late (38 days) ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment. Transient ST segment depression was much commoner during late (32% patients) than early (14%) monitoring. Most transient ischaemia (greater than 85% episodes) was silent and 80% of patients had only silent episodes. During late monitoring painful ST depression was accompanied by greater ST depression and tended to occur at a higher heart rate. Late transient ischaemia showed a diurnal distribution, occurred at a higher initial heart rate, and was more often accompanied by a further increase in heart rate than early ischaemia. Thus in the first 2 months after myocardial infarction transient ischaemia became increasingly common and more closely associated with increased myocardial oxygen demand. Because transient ischaemic episodes during early and late ambulatory monitoring have dissimilar characteristics they may also have different pathophysiologies and prognostic implications. ',\n",

Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown definitely to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms to explain this protective action of beta blockers have never been elucidated conclusively, and include the antiarrhythmic and myocardial oxygen demand-reducing effects of the drugs. An antithrombotic mechanism has also been suggested. However, beta blockers have relatively weak antiplatelet activity, suggesting that their antithrombotic effects may be related to prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability of beta blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surges, may protect a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque from fracture, thereby reducing risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction and death.

The initial defect contrasts and myocardial-to-lung ratios were similar by both agents but myocardial-to-liver ratio was lower by [123I]MPDA at 5 min, which became similar to 201Tl at 5 hr. Normal percent myocardial clearances of both agents were comparable and significantly higher than those in defect zones. Thus [123I]MPDA is suitable for myocardial imaging and correlates closely with 201Tl for initial postexercise myocardial uptake and defect reversibility. Defect reversibility appears to result from differential myocardial clearance from normal and ischemic regions. ',\n",

Because of the large differential diagnosis, many diagnostic tests are available for its evaluation. However, a cause of syncope is not established in 38% to 47% of patients despite these tests. In those patients in whom a diagnosis can be assigned, the history and physical examination identify a potential cause in 49% to 85%. Furthermore, in 8% of additional patients, history and physical examination are suggestive of causes that need confirmation by specific tests. Routine blood tests rarely yield diagnostically helpful information. In those patients in whom a potential cause for syncope is identified, arrhythmias are diagnosed by electrocardiogram in 2% to 11% of patients, cardiac monitoring in 3% to 27% (telemetry or Holter), stress test in less than 1%, carotid massage in less than 1%, and electrophysiologic studies in less than 3%. Diagnosis of arrhythmias as a cause of syncope is problematic because symptomatic correlation during electrocardiographic monitoring is rarely found (approximately 4%), and as a result, there is no uniform agreement on diagnostic criteria for abnormalities. Similar problems exist in the use of electrophysiologic studies. Upright tilt testing and psychiatric examination may be useful in evaluation of recurrent syncope of unknown cause in patients without organic heart disease. Based on the results of recent studies, strategies for evaluation of patients with syncope are possible that utilize selective and goal-directed diagnostic testing. ',\n",

Intragastric ethanol stimulates mucosal formation of leukotriene C4 in the rat stomach. The present study demonstrates that the increase in leukotriene C4 formation begins within 30 seconds and is maximal within 5 minutes, closely paralleled by the appearance of hemorrhagic lesions. Leukotriene C4 formation returns to prechallenge levels within 3 hours, although erosions still persist. Intragastric 0.2N NaOH, acidified 100 mmol/L taurocholate, 25% NaCl, or 0.6N HCl did not consistently increase leukotriene C4 formation despite severe mucosal injury. A number of sulfhydryl-containing or sulfhydryl-blocking agents as well as metals protected against mucosal damage and simultaneously prevented the stimulation of leukotriene C4 formation induced by ethanol. None of the agents increased and some virtually abolished mucosal formation of prostaglandin E2, indicating that gastroprotection can occur completely independently of the endogenous prostaglandin system. The leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886 markedly suppressed gastric leukotriene C4 formation but did not protect against damage caused by ethanol, NaOH, NaCl, or acidified taurocholate. Oral indomethacin reduced the ex vivo formation of both prostaglandin E2 and, to a lesser extent, leukotriene C4 in the gastric mucosa, inducing a shift in the balance from protective prostaglandins to proulcerogenic leukotriene C4. Pretreatment with MK-886, however, did not significantly diminish indomethacin-induced lesions. These data suggest that leukotriene C4 is not the exclusive mediator of gastric injury caused by necrotizing agents or indomethacin. On the other hand, certain protective compounds exhibit a striking parallelism between protection and inhibition of ethanol-induced leukotriene C4 formation, suggesting that they may affect a target crucial for both mucosal injury and stimulation of 5-lipoxygenase.

We combined the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor metyrosine in an attempt to better manage the hypertension of patients with pheochromocytoma undergoing surgical resection. This report reviews the cases of 25 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for known intra-abdominal pheochromocytoma. Each patient had elevated serum or urine levels of catecholamines or their metabolites. Nineteen patients were prepared before operation with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine and six patients were given phenoxybenzamine alone. There were no significant differences in maximum, minimum, or mean blood pressure before or after tumor resection between patients who received metyrosine and those who did not. However careful review suggested that those who received metyrosine had more severe disease as judged by biochemical criteria. Study of selected patients matched for age and severity of disease suggested that the intraoperative blood pressure management of patients prepared with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine was facilitated. In addition metyrosine-prepared patients lost less blood and required less volume replacement during surgery than did non-metyrosine-prepared patients. There were no apparent differences in postoperative fluid requirements. Although the study is not a prospective randomized trial, a retrospective review of patients managed with the combination of phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine suggests that surgery to resect pheochromocytoma can be better performed with both drugs than with phenoxybenzamine alone. The combination regimen appears to result in better blood pressure control, less blood loss, and the need for less intraoperative fluid replacement than does the traditional method of single-agent alpha-adrenergic blockade.

Review of the statutory and other legal controls over interhospital transfers is precipitated by its recent amendment and the fining of a Texas physician for transferring a high-risk obstetric patient without following the statutory guidelines. These events are part of a pattern of increasing regulation of the practice of medicine. Physicians and hospital administrators responsible for hospital transfer policies should be aware of regulatory developments. Hospitals contemplating transfer of patients must develop transfer policies that comply with governing law, including state law. A transfer policy should provide guidelines as to when a patient is \"stable for transfer\". Patients may not be transferred unless a physician can certify that delay attendant to transfer will not be detrimental. Furthermore, the policy should specify the procedures to be followed to effect a transfer and any documentation that the physician will have to complete. ',\n",
       " 775: 'Does percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty accelerate atherosclerotic lesions? Recent reports have suggested that angioplasty may cause or accelerate coronary arterial stenoses secondary to traumatic injury. Ninety-four coronary angiograms performed in a 1 yr period were reviewed in patients who had successful coronary angioplasty 6 to 30 mo (mean 10.7) prior to restudy. Restenosis was found in 43 of 140 dilated lesions (31%) and in 41 of 94 patients (44%). Thirty-three (35%) patients had new or progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site. New or progressive lesions occurred with similar frequency in the arteries that did not have angioplasty (23/155 = 15%) as in the arteries that did (13/127 = 10%; chi-square n.s.). In the arteries which underwent angioplasty, new or progressive lesions occurred as commonly proximal to the PTCA site (7/14, 50%) as distal (6/13, 46%). New or progressive lesions occurred in 29% of patients with concomitant restenosis, and 40% of those without restenosis (chi-square n.s.). No clinical, angiographic, or procedural factors distinguished patients with new and progressive lesions in target vessels from those without these lesions in target vessels. Patients with progressive lesions anywhere in the coronary tree were more likely to have had a shorter duration of anginal symptoms before angioplasty and a family history of coronary disease when compared with patients without progressive atherosclerosis. In conclusion, new and progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site occur after the procedure but appear unrelated to the restenosis process or traumatic injury by angioplasty instrumentation.

We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody.

       " 779: \"Screening for total cholesterol. Do the National Cholesterol Education Program's recommendations detect individuals at high risk of coronary heart disease? BACKGROUND. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has provided guidelines for identification of persons at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) because of lipid abnormalities. These recommendations are based on total cholesterol as the initial screening tool and have become the stimulus for clinic- and community-based screening programs nationwide. However, the use of the guidelines may be problematic because individuals may have total cholesterol levels in the desirable range but low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels considered at high risk. This study evaluates the ability of the NCEP screening recommendations to identify correctly persons at high risk of CHD because of lipid abnormalities. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using the NCEP guidelines, we simulated a population-based screening program with data from visits 1 and 2 of the Lipid Research Clinics Program Prevalence Study. Individuals were considered to be at high risk of CHD if they had LDL levels greater than 160 mg/dl or HDL levels less than 35 mg/dl. Following the NCEP process, 21% of those with high LDL concentrations and 66% of those with low HDL concentrations would not be routinely referred for immediate treatment. Overall, 41% of those at high risk of CHD would not be promptly evaluated. The sensitivity of the guidelines for promptly identifying individuals with lipoprotein abnormalities is 59%. CONCLUSIONS. This relatively low sensitivity of total cholesterol as a screening tool should be the impetus for rethinking the screening guidelines. Specifically, the cost-benefit ratio of routine screening for lipoproteins, particularly HDL cholesterol, needs to be carefully considered. \",\n",

Peliosis hepatis is characterized by cystic, blood-filled spaces in the liver and is seen in patients with chronic infections or advanced cancer and as a consequence of therapy with anabolic steroids. Cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infection that occurs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; its histologic appearance is that of a pseudoneoplastic vascular proliferation. METHODS. We studied liver tissue from eight HIV-infected patients with peliosis hepatis, two of whom also had cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. For comparison we examined tissue from four patients who had peliosis hepatis without HIV infection. Tissues were examined histologically on routine sections and with special stains and electron microscopy. RESULTS. The histologic features seen in peliosis hepatis associated with HIV infection, but not in the four cases unrelated to HIV infection, were myxoid stroma and clumps of a granular purple material that on Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy proved to be bacilli. The bacilli, which could not be cultured, were morphologically identical to those found in the skin lesions of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. The clinical courses of two of the patients with this \"bacillary peliosis hepatis\" indicate that it responds to antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS. HIV-associated bacillary peliosis hepatis is an unusual, treatable opportunistic infection, probably caused by the same organism that causes cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. Our failure to find bacilli in non-HIV-associated cases implies that other pathogenetic mechanisms may also be responsible for peliosis hepatis. ',\n",

Push-enteroscopy using a disinfected colonoscope was performed on 39 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Our results show that: (1) A high percentage of patients (38%) have pathological lesions responsible for bleeding located in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, which are readily detected by push-enteroscopy. (2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative. We conclude that push-enteroscopy has an important role to play in the early assessment of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. ',\n",

Guanine ribonucleosides, substituted at the C8 position with either a bromine or a thiol group, have recently been shown to regulate several immunologic responses. We have previously shown that 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MG) can replace the requirement for cytokines in the generation of MHC-restricted CTL. In this paper, we examined the ability of 8MG to induce MHC-nonrestricted killer cells. We found that 8MG did not induce significant lytic activity from normal resting lymphocytes. However, 8MG was able to synergize with minimal amounts of IL-2 in inducing lytic activity similar to lymphokine-activated killers (LAK) in that both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor cells were killed. Both the precursors and effectors of 8MG-LAK activity were similar to NK cells and were CD4- CD8- asialo-GM1+ NK1.1+. Similar to IL-2-induced LAK, 8MG-LAK were B220+. 8MG appeared to \"stage\" these precursor lymphocytes to become more responsive to IL-2 because optimal induction of 8MG-LAK required preincubation with 8MG before the addition of IL-2. This \"staging\" appeared to be due to the release of a \"second signal\" since it was readily inhibited by cyclosporine A. Anti-IFN-alpha beta was as efficient as cyclosporine A in inhibiting 8MG-LAK generation, whereas anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-1 did not exhibit significant inhibition. These findings suggest that 8MG can be of possible utility as an IL-2-sparing agent in LAK generation from NK cells. ',\n",

The rapidity of postpartum disease recovery for severe preeclampsia associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome) has not been well studied. Between January 1980 and March 1989, 158 pregnancies with preeclampsia-eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome were managed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The 70 patients with platelet nadir below 50,000/microL (class 1 HELLP syndrome) required as long as 11 days for all members to achieve a platelet recovery concentration of more than 100,000/microL, whereas all 88 gravidas with platelet nadir between 50,000-100,000/microL (class 2 HELLP syndrome) exceeded this platelet concentration by the sixth postpartum day, a statistically significant difference (P less than .0001). The interval between delivery and the onset of diuresis (mean +/- SD) was significantly longer in class 1 than in class 2 patients with milder disease (22.7 +/- 18.9 compared with 15.9 +/- 11.1 hours). Significantly more postpartum days were required in class 1 than in class 2 HELLP parturients for the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration to decrease below 500 IU/L (4.2 +/- 4.9 compared with 3.2 +/- 2.7 days). No women in the class 2 group required plasma exchange therapy to effect disease arrest and reversal, but 11 of 58 severely ill women in class 1 were treated with this modality. We conclude that the platelet count and LDH serum concentration, as indicators of HELLP severity and recovery, are clinically useful tools and that a more protracted postpartum recovery period should be expected for progressively severe expressions of HELLP syndrome.

DESIGN--Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study. SETTING--Hospital outpatient clinics in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS--Twenty clinically stable patients (13 women, seven men) with nocturnal asthma, median age 39 (range 18-60) years. INTERVENTIONS--Salmeterol 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms and placebo taken each morning and evening by metered dose inhaler. Rescue salbutamol inhalers were provided throughout the run in and study periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Improvement in nocturnal asthma as measured by peak expiratory flow rates and change in sleep quality as measured by electroencephalography. RESULTS--Salmeterol improved the lowest overnight peak flow rate at both 50 micrograms (difference in median values (95% confidence interval for difference in medians) 69 (18 to 88) l/min) and 100 micrograms (72 (23 to 61) l/min) doses twice daily. While taking salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily patients had an objective improvement in sleep quality, spending less time awake or in light sleep (-9 (-4 to -44) min) and more time in stage 4 sleep (26 (6-34) min).

There were 476 patients who had aortic valve replacement, 234 who had mitral valve replacement, and 44 who had double valve replacement. The standard-profile design was used in 508 patients and the low-profile design in 321 patients. Follow-up was obtained for 97% of patients, with calculation of event-free probabilities. At 10 years the overall probability of freedom from structural failure was 48% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 44% +/- 15% after mitral valve replacement, and 79% +/- 11% after double valve replacement. Although at 5 years the probability of failure was statistically lower with the low-profile design, this favorability was lost by 6 years. Freedom from structural failure was only 47% +/- 7% for the standard-profile valve at 10 years. Thus the probability of freedom from reoperation was only 46% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 39% +/- 6% after mitral valve replacement, and 65% +/- 20% after double valve replacement at 10 years. Thromboembolism occurred in 69 patients, for a predicted freedom from this complication at 10 years of 79% +/- 3% after aortic, 73% +/- 7% after mitral, and 96% +/- 4% after double valve replacement.

A total of 648 arterial segments were measured, yielding a highly significant correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined cross-sectional area (r = 0.96, p = 0.0001). Similarly, a highly significant linear relation was observed between videodensitometry and caliper-determined diameter (r = 0.95, p = 0.0001). When data subsets for small, medium and large arterial segments were examined, higher variability in the correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined area was observed in the large segments (greater than 10 mm2). In addition, caliper-estimated areas tended to be slightly smaller than videodensitometry-estimated areas in these segments. For diameter estimations, correlations between caliper and videodensitometry data were similar for the entire range of arterial segment sizes. Intra- and interobserver variability was low for both caliper and videodensitometry determination of diameter or area.

       " 799: 'Percutaneous support devices for high risk or complicated coronary angioplasty. Indications for coronary angioplasty have expanded to include patients with unstable acute ischemic syndromes, severe multivessel coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function. Several mechanical approaches have been developed as adjuncts to high risk coronary angioplasty to improve patient tolerance of coronary balloon occlusion and maintain hemodynamic stability in the event of complications. These percutaneous techniques include intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, anterograde transcatheter coronary perfusion, coronary sinus retroperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, Hemopump left ventricular assistance and partial left heart bypass. The intraaortic balloon pump provides hemodynamic support and ameliorates ischemia by decreasing myocardial work; it may be inserted for periprocedural complications or before angioplasty in patients with ischemia or hypotension. Anterograde distal coronary artery perfusion may be accomplished passively through an autoperfusion catheter or by active pumping of oxygenated blood or fluorocarbons through the central lumen of an angioplasty catheter. Synchronized coronary sinus retroperfusion produces pulsatile blood flow via the cardiac veins to the coronary bed distal to a stenosis. Both perfusion techniques limit development of ischemic chest pain and myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing prolonged balloon inflations. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass provides complete systemic hemodynamic support which is independent of intrinsic cardiac function or rhythm and has been employed prophylactically in very high risk patients before coronary angioplasty or emergently for abrupt closure. These and newer support devices, while associated with significant complications, may ultimately improve the safety of coronary angioplasty and allow its application to those who would otherwise not be candidates for revascularization.

Evolution of surgical techniques for repair of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture initially involved differentiation of these lesions from prior experience with surgical approaches to congenital ventricular septal defects, which were in the main not applicable. Second, understanding of the differing anatomical locations of postinfarction ventricular septal defects required innovation in terms of the location of the cardiotomy and type of repair necessary to achieve a successful result in any given patient. The gradual appreciation of different clinical courses pursued by patients after postinfarction ventricular septal rupture both in terms of location of the defect and the degree of right ventricular functional impairment has led to increased urgency relative to the timing of surgical repair. The incorporation of specific anatomical concepts of surgical repair and better understanding of the time course of physiological deterioration of patients can ultimately lead to an integrated approach aimed toward improved salvage of patients suffering this catastrophic complication of acute myocardial infarction.

Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models.

Since the visual cortex is heavily weighted by representation of the central retina, peripheral lesions, including those producing peripheral visual field abnormalities that do not impinge upon central fixation, may produce relatively little disturbance of the VEP. As with most tests, electrophysiologic studies of the visual system must be placed in context of the entire examination, including the patient's history and neurologic and especially neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. Electrophysiologic testing has three main uses in neurology. Pattern-reversal VEPs may be useful in detecting hidden visual loss in multiple sclerosis; VEPs and ERGs can distinguish function from organic visual loss; and VEPs and ERGs can be useful in the diagnosis of visual loss in nonverbal patients, especially in children. \",\n",

The disease is characterized clinically by variable weakness accentuated by repetitive muscular activity and usually responding to the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Myasthenia Gravis is a complex disease and requires understanding of the many facets of its natural history and immunological basis to ensure optimal individual patient management. The long-term goal is control of the immunological imbalance; treatment regimens include thymectomy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis. The common use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provides symptomatic relief during variable daily muscular activity. Disability due to myasthenia gravis is to a large extent reversible and death is preventable. Early recognition of myasthenia gravis and appropriate treatment are often rewarded by remission that may be permanent. ',\n",

Surgical correction of truncus arteriosus requires the creation of right ventricular to pulmonary artery continuity and closure of the ventricular septal defect. A variety of conduits have been used including valved and nonvalved. Despite a significant incidence of truncal valvar stenosis and insufficiency, this valve has seldom been replaced. We present 4 cases of truncus arteriosus with truncal valvar stenosis or insufficiency that were repaired using two valved homografts: one to create the pulmonary outflow tract and the other to replace the abnormal truncal valve. Two of these patients are doing well after 4 months. Another child survived the operation and did well for 2 months when she died suddenly. The last child died 14 hours postoperatively from low cardiac output syndrome secondary to diabetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. When truncal valvar abnormalities are present, the primary repair of truncus arteriosus in an infant should include replacement of the truncal valve. Total correction can be successfully achieved using two valved homografts, resulting in long-term palliation and freedom from thromboembolic events and the use of anticoagulants. ',\n",
       " 808: \"The rat glucagon gene is regulated by a protein kinase A-dependent pathway in pancreatic islet cells. A cAMP response element (CRE) has been identified in the proximal 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene, and activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway in fetal rat intestinal cells leads to an increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts. In contrast, the human glucagon gene does not contain a similar CRE, and the results of studies using immortalized rat and hamster islet cell lines have suggested that glucagon gene expression may not be regulated by cAMP. To reconcile these observations, we have studied the control of glucagon gene expression. Incubation of primary rat islet cell cultures with forskolin in the presence of low (0.5 g/liter) or high (2.0 g/L) glucose resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts. Forskolin also stimulated the secretion and synthesis of immunoreactive glucagon. The importance of the protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the regulation of glucagon gene expression was also examined in hamster islet InR1-G9 cells. Cotransfection of a glucagon-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene containing the glucagon CRE and a cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase-A resulted in stimulation of glucagon-CAT activity in hamster islet cells. Catalytic subunit cotransfection also activated somatostatin-CAT, but no activation of RSVCAT was detected. The results of these experiments suggest that the rat glucagon gene is regulated by a protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the endocrine pancreas. \",\n",

The aim of this study was to determine whether intravenous streptokinase administered with or without oral aspirin to patients with evolving myocardial infarction reduces the inducibility of ventricular tachycardia at electrophysiologic study and thus the risk of sudden death in infarct survivors. Of 159 patients randomized at Westmead Hospital to the multicenter Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) after streptokinase and aspirin in acute myocardial infarction, 87 underwent electrophysiologic testing 6 to 28 days after infarction to determine their risk of subsequent ventricular arrhythmias (streptokinase 20 patients; aspirin 25 patients; streptokinase and aspirin 21 patients; both placebos 21 patients). Patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing had similar clinical characteristics to those of patients who did not. The stimulation protocol comprised up to and including four extrastimuli applied to the right ventricular apex at twice diastolic threshold. An abnormal result was defined as ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length greater than or equal to 230 ms lasting greater than or equal to 10 s. Ventricular tachycardia was inducible at electrophysiologic study in 8 patients who received placebo streptokinase, but in no patient who received active streptokinase (8 of 46 versus 0 of 41; p = 0.005, Fischer's exact test). Ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 4 patients who received aspirin therapy and 4 who did not (4 of 41 versus 4 of 46; p = NS). During a mean follow-up period of 39 +/- 9 months, there were no spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or witnessed sudden death in the streptokinase-treated group compared with three such events in the placebo-treated group (p = 0.13). When compared with placebo therapy, intravenous streptokinase substantially reduced the incidence of inducible ventricular tachycardia in infarct survivors.

Pneumocephalus occurs in 0.5 to 1.0% of head trauma, but may also occur after neurologic surgery, or as a result of eroding infection or neoplasm. The pathophysiology involves the presence of craniodural fistula allowing ingress of air. A ball-valve mechanism may allow air to enter but not exit the cranium, or CSF leak permits air entrance as fluid leaves the intracranial space. While a \"succession splash\" is considered diagnostic of pneumocephalus, most patients have nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headache. Therefore, a high index of suspicion in a patient with recent head trauma is necessary. The diagnosis is made radiographically by CT scan. This is generally performed to rule out intracranial hematoma or cerebral contusion in head trauma, but will reveal even very small quantities of air to the unsuspecting physician. Therapy is often noninvasive, allowing the craniodural defect to heal spontaneously. Selected situations require immediate operative repair of the fistula. ',\n",

In 70 normal patients, all planes were imaged with a similar frequency (74-76%) except for the posterior coronal plane, which was imaged 59% of the time. Among the first 35 cases, 17% had a complete study, compared with 71% of the second 35 cases. Transvaginal sonography established or changed the diagnosis in five of the 13 cases with central nervous system or other abnormalities.

Computerised tomography (CT) scans performed on 95 patients were normal, evidence for covert alcoholism was lacking and there was a familial incidence of approximately 2%. By contrast, the group of 39 patients who did not meet the criteria for TGA had a significantly worse prognosis with a high incidence of major vascular events. The groups could not be distinguished on the basis of behavioural characteristics during the attack. The following classification was proposed: 1) pure TGA--attacks fulfilling the strict criteria, and of more than one hour in duration which do not require detailed investigation, 2) probable epileptic amnesia--attacks of less than an hour or rapidly recurrent, 3) probable transient ischaemic amnesia, a minority of cases with additional focal neurological deficits during the attack.

       " 813: 'When is a prognostic factor useful? A guide for the perplexed. Traditionally, a number of variables have been used to predict outcome in patients with early-stage breast cancer. These tests are simple to perform and relatively inexpensive. Recently, a number of new factors, eg, tumor proliferative index, nuclear DNA content, and amplification or overexpression of growth-promoting genes or oncogenes have been identified as potential predictors of outcome in patients with breast cancer. There is now increasing pressure to introduce such tests into routine clinical practice. How does a clinical practitioner identify which test, or group of tests, best predicts adverse outcome and whether any more clinically useful information is provided than with the use of more traditional factors alone? The aim of a prognostic test in breast cancer is to predict which patients are destined to develop a recurrence of cancer and those who are not. The prognostic usefulness of a test can be expressed in terms of relative risk (RR), which is the ratio of the risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients who test positive to the risk in those who test negative. Methodologic guidelines that should be satisfied by a study evaluating the predictive ability of a test include the following: (1) Was an inception cohort assembled? (2) Was the referral pattern described? (3) Were laboratory and clinical outcomes assessed in a blinded fashion? (4) Was complete follow-up achieved? (5) Was adjustment for extraneous prognostic factors carried out? (6) Were appropriate statistical methods used? An approach is suggested to help the clinician choose the test, or combination of tests, likely to discriminate between \"high-\" and \"low-risk\" patients in his/her own practice. The decision regarding what particular threshold value (risk) defined by a prognostic test (or series of tests) warrants adjuvant therapy for an individual patient is a complex one but should be based on a clear presentation of the risks and benefits to the patient.

Sotalol significantly reduced VPCs in patients receiving both low (n = 38) and high (n = 39) doses, compared with patients (n = 37) receiving placebo (by 75 and 88%, respectively, vs 10%; p less than 0.001, sotalol vs placebo; p less than 0.05, high vs low dose). The individual efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC reduction) was achieved in 34% of low-dose and 71% of high-dose sotalol versus 6% of placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.003, sotalol vs placebo; p = 0.007, high vs low dose). Repetitive beats were suppressed 25% by placebo (difference not significant), 80% by low-dose (p less than 0.003) and 78% by high-dose sotalol (p less than 0.005). Sotalol decreased heart rate (by 24 to 25%, p less than 0.001) and increased PR (by 4 to 6%, p less than 0.001) and corrected JT intervals (by 12 to 13%, p less than 0.001), but did not change ejection fraction. Proarrhythmia (nonfatal) occurred in 3 sotalol and in 2 placebo patients. Nine discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (1 low dose and 8 high dose, p less than 0.02).

To determine the feasibility of the endovascular management of intimal defects while comparing the accuracy of arteriography with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasonography, we developed an in vivo model of arterial intimal flaps. In 10 superficial femoral arteries of five anesthetized mongrel dogs, intimal flaps were constructed and then imaged by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. A flexible microbiopsy forceps was used to remove each intimal flap under angioscopic guidance. Arteriographic lumen diameters were measured and cross-sectional areas calculated. Corresponding measurements by angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound with reduction in luminal area at the flap were obtained by use of computerized planimetry. Uniplanar arteriography identified 60% (6/10) of the intimal flaps, whereas angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound demonstrated 100%. Lumen diameter (in millimeters) measured by arteriography (3.4 +/- 0.6) correlated significantly with measurements by angioscopy (3.5 +/- 0.5, r = 0.77) and intravascular ultrasound (3.5 +/- 0.6, r = 0.96). Similarly, lumen area (square millimeters) by arteriography (9.2 +/- 2.9) correlated with measurements by angioscopy (8.9 +/- 2.2, r = 0.82) and intravascular ultrasound (8.6 +/- 2.7, r = 0.91). Reduction in lumen area by the flap by angioscopy (37 +/- 7%) and intravascular ultrasound (33 +/- 8%) also correlated significantly (r = 0.72). The intimal flaps were removed successfully in all 10 arteries as confirmed by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. We conclude that the endovascular management of intimal defects is possible.

The Health Care Financing Administration has contracted with state peer review organizations (PROs) in its effort to assure the quality of services and eliminate unreasonable and inappropriate care provided Medicare beneficiaries. By law, each state PRO must select 10 procedures for precertification. Coronary angioplasty has been chosen by 45 PROs for precertification and criteria in each state were developed with the advice of local physicians. This report describes the findings of a survey of these precertification criteria in an effort to determine their variability and to compare the PRO criteria to published national criteria created by expert panels. Current precertification criteria of Medicare beneficiaries show significant variability in the priorities and the clinical practice of cardiologists in performing coronary angioplasty, despite established and published guidelines for its safe and efficacious use. It is likely that the establishment of locally based criteria for coronary angioplasty will be geographically uneven and probably have a less than expected impact on the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.

Factors controlling glucose metabolism after IV load were studied in nine patients with compensated cirrhosis and in six age-matched controls. The time courses of glucose, insulin, and C peptide were analyzed by means of the minimal model technique. In cirrhosis, insulin sensitivity was reduced by approximately 70% and glucose-dependent glucose uptake (glucose effectiveness) by 45%. Decreased glucose effectiveness explained 65% of the variance of glucose disappearance and correlated with the ratio of urinary creatinine to height, an independent measure of muscle mass (r = 0.839). beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, measured on C-peptide kinetics, was variable and increased on average by 170% and 107% (first-phase and second-phase, respectively). The total amount of insulin secreted by beta-cells in the course of the study was nearly doubled, whereas the basal insulin secretion rate was in the normal range. The time courses of hepatic extraction of insulin did not differ between groups, and basal extraction was on average 58% in controls and 56% in patients with cirrhosis. It was reduced to 30% in a single patient who had severe hepatocellular failure and large spontaneous portosystemic shunting. We conclude that the alterations in glucose metabolism of cirrhosis include a decreased insulin sensitivity, a reduced glucose effectiveness, and an increased pancreatic responsiveness to glucose, leading to hyperinsulinemia. The hepatic extraction of insulin is reduced only in the very advanced stages of the disease, possibly because of a large reserve capacity of the hepatic parenchyma. ',\n",

Our aim was to determine whether plasma vasopressin and oxytocin levels were altered in healthy volunteers who did or did not develop nausea during vection, an optokinetic stimulus which produces the illusion of self-motion. Vection was produced by rotating a drum with an inner surface of black and white vertical stripes around the seated stationary subject. Gastric myoelectrical activity was recorded continuously throughout the experiment with electrodes positioned on the abdominal surface. Plasma samples were obtained before vection and after drum rotation stopped when nausea and tachygastria were present. Vasopressin and oxytocin were extracted from plasma and quantified by RIA. During vection six subjects reported nausea and developed gastric dysrhythmias; six other subjects had no nausea and remained in normal 3-cpm myoelectrical rhythms. Vasopressin and oxytocin values before vection were similar in each group of subjects. One minute after vection stopped, plasma vasopressin levels were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in subjects experiencing nausea and tachygastrias (35.4 +/- 26.7 pmol/L) than in those without symptoms (2.7 +/- 0.47 pmol/L). Oxytocin levels were unchanged by either vection or nausea. It is concluded that 1) vasopressin, not oxytocin, neurons in the magnocellular-neurohypophyseal system are activated during vection-induced nausea and gastric dysrhythmias; and 2) illusory self-motion may be used safely to study the neuroendocrine responses to brain-gut interactions and nausea in man.

Dimensions of in vitro ultrasound images from human arteries (eight normal and nine arteriosclerotic) were compared with those from histologic sections of the vessels. In addition, in vivo ultrasound studies (23 normal and 22 arteriosclerotic) of canine femoral arteries were compared with luminal dimensions obtained from angiograms of the vessels. The correlation of in vitro ultrasound images to luminal diameters (n = 22, r = 0.96), adventitial diameters (n = 19, r = 0.83), and wall thickness (n = 19, r = 0.68) in normal human vessels was significant (p less than 0.05). In vitro measurements of images and histologic specimens from human atherosclerotic arteries also correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with luminal diameters (n = 27, r = 0.91), adventitial diameters (n = 24, r = 0.60), and wall thickness (n = 24, r = 0.62). Morphologically, in vitro images of the wall of normal human arteries had a concentric laminated appearance and atherosclerotic vessels had patchy echodense and echolucent areas. In vivo studies showed significant correlation of diameters for both normal (n = 16, r = 0.91, p less than 0.05) and arteriosclerotic (n = 16, r = 0.57, p less than 0.05) canine arteries compared with luminal dimensions measured from uniplanar angiograms.

Disrupted coronary morphologic integrity, particularly with large dissections, may be associated with an increased risk of acute coronary closure. A percutaneously placed coronary vascular stent may rapidly alleviate acute or threatened coronary closure and could reduce morbidity. Between October 1989 and June 1990, placement of a balloon-expandable, flexible metallic coil (Gianturco-Roubin) coronary stent was attempted 16 times in 15 Mayo Clinic patients--for treatment of actual or threatened abrupt coronary closure in 10 patients, for primary treatment of a lesion judged to be at high risk for dissection with conventional balloon angioplasty in 1, and for elective treatment of restenotic lesions in 5. Placement of the stent was successful in 15 attempts (94%). Associated complications, which were uncommon, were similar to those noted after balloon angioplasty. No early deaths occurred, and no patient required coronary artery bypass grafting. Stents were successfully placed in both urgent and elective circumstances in native coronary arteries and saphenous vein grafts, and they were used in primary atheromatous and restenotic lesions. Our initial experience with this metallic coil stent indicates that it is efficacious for vascular disruption that is threatening or causing coronary closure after angioplasty.

To evaluate relationships between lesions in the lung periphery and surrounding structures, particularly vessels and bronchi, axial multiplanar reconstruction (AMPR) computed tomography (CT) was used to study 26 patients who underwent surgical resection of pulmonary nodules less than 3 cm in diameter. Findings at AMPR CT, conventional CT, and digital radiographic tomography were compared with findings obtained at evaluation of the resected specimen with regard to the ability to display the relationships between vessels, bronchi, and lesions. AMPR CT was significantly superior to conventional CT and digital radiographic tomography in detecting involvement of pulmonary vessels (P less than .001). Involvement of pulmonary veins was seen in all lung cancers, whereas such involvement was seen in only one of eight nonneoplastic lesions.

The chief abnormalities consisted of an increase in postprandial duodenal retroperistalsis (healed duodenal ulceration, 12 +/- 1 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 12 +/- 1; control, 6 +/- 1; mean +/- SEM: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively), a reduction in pressure waves sweeping aborally through the duodenum after the meal (healed duodenal ulceration, 22 +/- 4 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 23 +/- 3; control, 34 +/- 4: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.04 and P less than 0.05, respectively), and an increased incidence of atypical, complex forms of coordinated duodenal motor activity throughout the study (postprandial data; healed duodenal ulceration, 8 +/- 1 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 10 +/- 1; control, 4 +/- 1: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.02 and P less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, gastric emptying of the solid test meal was significantly delayed in healed, but not active, duodenal ulceration [half-emptying time, healed duodenal ulceration 185 minutes (117-235); active duodenal ulceration 102 minutes (80-200); control 107 minutes (78-130): healed duodenal ulceration vs. control, P less than 0.009]. Duodenal bulb pH was similar in controls and patients with active duodenal ulceration; however, bulb pH was less than 4 for a significantly greater period of time in healed duodenal ulceration compared with active ulcer patients, particularly after the meal. In conclusion, duodenal ulcer disease is associated with disturbed gastroduodenal motility, even when the ulcer is quiescent and when intraduodenal acidity is low. In healed duodenal ulceration, disturbed motility may promote ulcer relapse by impairing acid clearance from the bulb. However, in active ulceration other factors such as mucosal bicarbonate secretion may have a more influential role in determining intraduodenal pH. ',\n",

With the use of the C494 monoclonal antibody in an avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique, P-glycoprotein was detected in 17 of 20 tumor samples. Results were expressed in a semiquantitative manner, taking into account the number of positive tumor cells (N index) and the specific staining intensity (I index). The 17 patients with nonmetastatic cancer were followed from the first cycle of chemotherapy to cancer recurrence; subsequent to six cycles of chemotherapy, all of these patients except one were rendered clinically disease-free through surgery and/or radiation. The end point was defined as either local/regional recurrence or metastasis. Strong P-glycoprotein-positive staining in a majority of tumor cells (the N+/I+ phenotype) was significantly correlated with no initial response to chemotherapy (P less than .02) and with a shorter progression-free survival (P less than .02). Thus, the pretreatment evaluation of P-glycoprotein expression may be of prognostic value in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. ',\n",

This method eliminates the scalpel, results in fewer hematomas and infections, and leaves a smaller wound than conventional techniques. An extracutaneous fixation ring clamp encircles and firmly secures the vas without penetrating the skin. A sharp curved hemostat punctures and dilates the scrotal skin and vas sheath. The vas is delivered, cleaned and occluded by the surgeon's preferred technique. The contralateral vas is delivered through the same opening. The puncture wound contracts to about 2 mm., is not visible to the man and requires no sutures for closure. The reported incidence of hematoma in 179,741 men followed in China was 0.09%. No hematomas or infections were identified in the first 273 procedures performed by a surgeon in the United States. The operating time in China and for the last 50 United States procedures has ranged from 5 to 11 minutes. The disadvantage of the technique is the hand-on training and number of cases necessary to gain proficiency. However, the advantages for surgeons and patients should enhance the popularity of vasectomy. \",\n",

Leukotriene C4 is a potent constrictor of smooth muscle in vitro and may induce coronary vasoconstriction in vivo. To study leukotriene C4 release by neutrophils in patients with coronary artery disease, neutrophils were separated from blood samples taken from the coronary sinus and aorta in 20 patients with stable exertional angina and angiographically documented coronary artery narrowings (group I). Eight patients with normal coronary arteries were also studied (group II). To assess leukotriene C4 generation, neutrophils were incubated with calcium ionophore A 23187 (0.25 microM) and the supernatants obtained after centrifugation were analyzed for leukotriene C4 by radioimmunoassay. Patients in group I had a significantly lower release of leukotriene C4 from neutrophils separated from the coronary sinus blood than from those separated from aortic blood (4.33 +/- 0.69 versus 5.92 +/- 0.54 ng/ml, p less than 0.025), whereas patients in group II had a similar release of leukotriene C4 by the neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood and from aortic blood (6.0 +/- 0.72 versus 6.4 +/- 0.66 ng/ml, p = NS). Moreover, in group I patients, a significant correlation was found (p less than 0.01) between the extent of coronary artery disease (expressed by the Leaman coronary score) and the percent reduction in leukotriene C4 released from neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood as compared with leukotriene C4 produced by neutrophils separated from aortic blood. These data show that neutrophils from patients with coronary artery disease have a reduced ability to produce leukotriene C4 after stimulation by calcium ionophore A 23187. ',\n",

Two groups of 7 normal subjects (single dose study: 15 mg delapril v 18.75 mg captopril or 2.5 mg enalapril) and a group of 6 mildly hypertensive patients (1 week study: cross-over administration of 30 mg/day delapril, 37.5 mg/day captopril, or 5 mg/day enalapril) were studied. Another group of 6 patients with essential hypertension was treated with three ACE inhibitors for 4 weeks in a randomized order, with a 2 week washout period between active therapies. Aerosols of 1 mumol/L and 3 mumol/L capsaicin and 0.68% citric acid in 0.9% NaCl were generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer, and the frequency of cough was counted during inhalation. Delapril treatment resulted in substantially fewer patients with a significant increase (greater than or equal to 4 coughs during treatment than during the control period) in the frequency of cough than did captopril treatment. In the 1 and 4 week studies, enalapril and captopril had substantially more occurrences of significantly increased capsaicin-induced cough than did delapril.

Chronic suppurative hidradenitis is a disease of the apocrine glands occurring predominantly in the axillae of the anogenital region. Treatment, to date, has been frustrating. Prolonged antibiotic therapy and multiple incisions and drainage have been the usual form of therapy, but those surgical procedures leave patients with ugly scars; retracted, hypertrophic skin edges; and pitted, indurated and disfiguring abscesses. The only successful treatment to date has been wide excision of the entire apocrine gland-bearing tissues, such as radical vulvectomy, which often necessitates grafts to cover the surgically exposed areas. That has left patients with unsatisfactorily functioning vaginas and a mutilated appearance. Recently we instituted the use of the CO2 laser to treat these patients with the goal of eradicating the suppurative sinus tracts and the infected apocrine glands without removing large volumes of adjacent, unaffected tissue. Over the past eight years we treated 11 patients who had extensive, chronic hidradenitis of the anogenital area with the CO2 laser. The use of laser therapy for these patients has produced effective and less-mutilating results. Such treatment has been a successful option for treating this debilitating disease. ',\n",

The preliminary data show that the number of superficial and deep femoral lymph nodes removed from the 42 patients (mean number of nodes, 20; range, 8-32) was similar to the number reported in anatomy books. In addition, the five-year actuarial survival rate, 70%, was comparable to that in the literature.

Seventy women residents of Athens, consecutively admitted to the major state maternity hospital with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, were individually matched with women with a newly diagnosed pregnancy of the same order as the ectopic index pregnancy. Two control women were found for each of 63 cases, but only one control for each of the remaining seven cases. All cases and controls were interviewed by the same qualified obstetrician. Statistical analysis was undertaken with stratification of individual matched triplets and pairs, as well as through conditional multiple regression procedures. The relative risk of recurrence of an ectopic pregnancy was 6.39 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-21.04. Miscarriages did not increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The relative risk for subsequent ectopic pregnancy among women with one or more induced abortion, compared to women without such abortions, was 1.87 (CI 0.84-4.16) controlling only for the matching factors, and 1.71 (CI 0.69-4.27) when marital status (a possible selection factor) was also accounted for in the conditional logistic regression. There was no evidence for increasing risk with increasing number of induced abortions.

Of the patients with a perforating type of injury, 48.8% had a poor surgical outcome as compared with 19.9% with a penetrating type and 15.6% with a tangential type. This difference is statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.7 and 17.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). The most important factor in predicting overall outcome was the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of admission. Mortality and morbidity contributing to a poor surgical outcome were noted in only 6% of patients with a GCS score at admission of 13 to 15, in 24.6% of those with a GCS score of 9 to 12, in 57% of those with a GCS score of 6 to 8, and in 65% of those with a GCS score of 3 to 5.

The patients were five black and three white women, 56-87 years of age. The FNA specimen was cyst fluid in four cases (bloody in three, clear in one). All the aspirates showed cellular smears with small and large clusters of cells with papillary and/or cribriform configurations and numerous single epithelial cells. The cells were cuboidal to columnar with minimal atypia. ICPC was suggested by FNA in each case, and all the patients underwent surgical excision or mastectomy. Flow cytometry, performed on fresh FNA specimen in one case and on paraffin-embedded surgical tissue in all eight cases, showed seven tumors to be aneuploid and one to be diploid. The authors contend that ICPCs of breast have distinct cytomorphologic features that can be recognized by FNA. Because ICPC may present in cyst fluid, either bloody or clear, all breast cyst fluids from postmenopausal women should be examined cytologically. Flow cytometric demonstration of an aneuploid population may assist in confirming malignancy in this lesion. ',\n",
       " 845: 'Tumor angiogenesis and metastasis--correlation in invasive breast carcinoma. BACKGROUND. Experimental evidence suggests that the growth of a tumor beyond a certain size requires angiogenesis, which may also permit metastasis. To investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without). METHODS. Using light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor VIII. The microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable. RESULTS. Both microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. The mean (+/- SD) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. The corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (P = 0.003 and P less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). For each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; P = 0.003). The microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. For each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS. The number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both). Assessment of tumor angiogenesis may therefore prove valuable in selecting patients with early breast carcinoma for aggressive therapy. ',\n",

The carotid-carotid cervical bypass is one surgical option for symptomatic atherosclerotic lesions of the innominate artery. Controversy exists regarding the necessity of surgically excluding the innominate plaque from the cerebral circuit. A canine study was instituted to characterize the hemodynamic alterations that occur in the right common carotid artery proximal to the bypass graft, termed the critical segment. The direction of flow in the critical segment determines whether emboli originating in the innominate may be propelled cranially despite a patent bypass graft. Six mongrel dogs underwent placement of an autogenous arterial crossover graft as a carotid-carotid bypass. A stenosis of the innominate artery was quantitatively altered, and an electromagnetic flowmeter measured the magnitude and direction of flow in the critical segment at three levels of diameter reduction in the innominate artery. For low-grade stenoses, flow in the critical segment was always prograde. For high-grade stenoses, the flow was always reversed. Stenoses between 57% and 67% yielded flow values of 10 +/- 24 ml/min, and it was in this range that mean flow reversal was found to occur. Even when the mean flow was near zero in the critical segment, flow was not stagnant but oscillated in antegrade and retrograde directions throughout the cardiac cycle. These data indicate that a carotid-carotid bypass causes complete flow reversal in the critical segment when there is high-grade stenosis in the innominate artery. Theoretical analysis of the hemodynamic circuit indicated that arm exercise would augment retrograde flow in the critical segment. ',\n",

Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space. It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order. The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall. Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament. This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.

To establish the diagnostic criteria for a sinus venosus atrial septal defect cross sectional echocardiograms, cineangiograms, and surgical notes of all patients with this diagnosis seen at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. Seven patients were identified. In each the extent of the atrial septum and the nature of the junction of the superior vena cava with the atria were evaluated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. All had overriding of the superior vena cava and abnormally connected right pulmonary veins. Six patients had undergone cardiac catheterisation and cineangiography. Five patients underwent surgical repair. The operative findings were consistent with the expected morphology in all five, and these features were additionally confirmed in a specimen from the cardiopathological museum. Therefore, the basic anatomical feature of a superior sinus venosus interatrial communication is a biatrial connection of the superior vena cava. This, together with anomalous drainage of the right sided pulmonary veins, results in an interatrial communication outside the confines of the true atrial septum. Overriding of the superior vena cava across the upper rim of the oval fossa is suggested as the pathognomonic diagnostic feature that can clearly be demonstrated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. In essence the lesion is an interatrial communication rather than an atrial septal defect. \",\n",

The pathogenetic mechanism for stroke is based partly on the stenotic narrowing of the carotid artery. A diameter reduction of 75% is frequently considered hemodynamically significant and indicative of an increased risk for neurological morbidity. We studied the cerebral blood flow in 7 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who also had severe bilateral carotid disease. The results were compared with the results in 17 patients without carotid disease who had bypass grafting. The cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon 133 washout technique before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia. Acid-base regulation was according to the alpha-stat theory, and blood pressure was kept greater than 50 mm Hg. The cerebral blood flow levels (mL.100g-1.min-1) before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass in the study group (30 +/- 11, 31 +/- 8, 47 +/- 20) (mean +/- standard deviation) were almost identical to those in the control group (30 +/- 11, 28 +/- 8, 47 +/- 12). The cerebral blood flow levels for the left and right hemispheres in the group with carotid disease were comparable and within normal ranges. In 2 patients, slight differences were noted between hemispheres, and this finding may indicate an increased risk for ischemia. These patients, however, did not show any signs of postoperative deficit. The flow limitations of critical carotid stenoses do not seem to imply a risk for cerebral hypoperfusion if cardiopulmonary perfusion is performed in a controlled manner. ',\n",

We examined the potential of x-irradiation, at clinical dose levels, to manipulate the cellular constituents and thereby change the consequences of transection injury to adult mammalian central nervous tissue (rat olfactory bulb). Irradiation resulted in reduction or elimination of reactive astrocytes at the site of incision provided that it was delivered within a defined time window postinjury. Under conditions optimal for the elimination of gliosis (15-18 days postinjury), irradiation of severed olfactory bulbs averted some of the degenerative consequences of lesion. We observed that irradiation was accompanied by prevention of tissue degeneration around the site of lesion, structural healing with maintenance of the typical cell lamination, and rescue of some axotomized mitral cells (principal bulb neurons). Thus radiation resulted in partial preservation of normal tissue morphology. It is postulated that intrusive cell populations are generated in response to injury and reactive astrocytes are one such group. Our results suggest that selective elimination of these cells by irradiation enabled some of the regenerative processes that are necessary for full recovery to maintain their courses. The cellular targets of these cells, their modes of intervention in recovery, and the potential role of irradiation as a therapeutic modality for injured central nervous system are discussed. ',\n",

A testicular sex cord stromal tumour with granulosa cell differentiation, typical of granulosa cell tumours of the adult type, was investigated immunohistologically on snap frozen and paraffin wax embedded material. The predominance of vimentin and the additional expression of cytokeratin subtypes 8 and 18, as well as the negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, accorded with results previously reported, for ovarian granulosa cell tumours; the lack of expression of desmoplakin, however, was a distinctive feature. Together with negative staining for leucocyte common antigen, the antigen pattern facilitates the differential diagnosis between granulosa cell tumour and undifferentiated carcinoma or gonadal lymphoma, although its suitability for differentiating within the group of gonadal stromal tumours seems to be limited. The small growth fraction, shown by the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, is typical of the clinical behaviour of granulosa cell tumours. The expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, also recently found in testicular Leydig cell tumours, may provoke new approaches to the management of testicular granulosa cell tumours, as well as a new hypothesis on the development of these tumours.

       " 857: 'Interphase cytogenetic analysis in the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders. Cytogenetic information usually is obtained through the direct analysis of chromosomes from cells arrested in metaphase. Recently, advances in molecular genetics have made it possible to acquire cytogenetic information through the study of interphase and terminally differentiated cells. By using chromosome-specific DNA probes or probes that are specific for certain chromosomal regions, and by employing techniques of in situ hybridization along with nonradioactive detection methods, it is now possible to detect numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities from nonmetaphase cells. When used as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetic analysis or when used together with knowledge of established cytogenetic findings for a particular malignancy, this new technology can serve to broaden the scope and utility of cytogenetic analysis beyond the limits of the present metaphase-based technology. Interphase cytogenetic analysis has application to the diagnosis and study of neoplastic disorders and, thus, has particular importance in pathology. ',\n",

An increased incidence of coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi was noted when compared with a non-PTCA cardiac autopsy population (five of 53 patients). Apparently there was an increased incidence of coronary atheroemboli and thromboemboli in the patients with coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi (eight patients) when compared with patients who did not have platelet-fibrin thrombi (five patients), although this was not statistically significant. There was no evidence of a systemic hypercoagulable state or of disseminated intravascular coagulation. The pathogenesis of this is unclear; however, vasospasm and a disruption of the endothelial surface induced by PTCA with subsequent platelet activation are possible causes. Although not statistically significant, there was a proponderance of female subjects (seven patients) and an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus (six patients) and hypertension (13 patients) when compared with a control population of all patients undergoing PTCA at The Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation in 1987, suggesting that diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and female sex may be clinical risk factors for fatal complications following PTCA.

The effect of brief myocardial ischemia on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP 70) was examined in an in vivo rabbit model of myocardial ischemia using Northern blotting. Functional studies were carried out in the open-chested anesthetized rabbit. The large marginal branch of the left circumflex was occluded four times for 5 min. Using piezoelectric crystals implanted midwall in the ischemic zone, end-diastolic length, end-systolic length, and percent segmental shortening were assessed. Expression of HSP 70 was measured by Northern blotting. A single 5-min coronary occlusion doubled the expression of HSP 70 whereas four cycles of 5 min of ischemia/5 min of reperfusion resulted in a threefold increase in HSP 70 mRNA (P less than 0.001). Measurements with the piezoelectric crystals showed mild myocardial dysfunction concomitant with the increase in HSP 70. This increase in HSP 70 mRNA after repetitive brief ischemia was transient, occurring as early as 1 h and returning to baseline by 24 h after ischemia. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to HSP 70 was used to compare sham and postischemic myocardial HSP 70 levels. Changes in the amount of HSP 70 were evident as early as 2 h and were even more striking at 24 h. ',\n",

Two hundred eighty-seven patients undergoing minor elective procedures under general anesthesia were studied. Four to six hours after anesthesia each patient completed a questionnaire assessing his or her own alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine consumption, and the occurrence of postoperative side effects. A highly significant difference was found between the caffeine consumption of patients with and without preoperative (P = 0.0035) and postoperative (P less than 0.0001) headache. Logistic regression analysis of trend between headache and caffeine consumption suggested that with each 100-mg increase in caffeine consumption, there was a 12% increase in the odds of headache developing in the immediate preoperative period (P less than 0.0066) and a 16% increase in the odds of postoperative headache developing (P less than 0.0001). No relationship was found between headache and the patients' age, sex, usual frequency of headache, consumption of alcohol or nicotine, or the anesthetic agents or adjuvants used. It is concluded that postoperative headache is related to caffeine intake and that this relationship is explained, at least in part, by a perioperative caffeine withdrawal syndrome. \",\n",

Forty-seven patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma were treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-cell therapy, using a hybrid IL-2 regimen. IL-2 was administered initially by intravenous bolus (10(5) U/kg [Cetus Corp, Emeryville, CA] every 8 hours for 3 days) during the priming phase, and subsequently by continuous infusion (3 x 10(6) U/m2 for 6 days); during this second treatment period, in vitro-generated LAK cells were administered. Despite selection of patients for good performance status (PS) (29, PS 0; 18, PS 1) prior nephrectomy (43 of the 47 patients), and low tumor burden, the response rate was low (two complete [CRs] and two partial responses [PRs], for an overall objective response rate of 9%).

In most cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia, the ipsilateral lung was underdeveloped morphologically and biochemically compared with the contralateral lung. However, both ipsilateral and contralateral lungs were well developed in some cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia. Thus, acinar development of hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia is varied.

Acute autonomic neuropathy can be primarily cholinergic without orthostatic hypotension (26%) or pandysautonomic (74%) involving sympathetic adrenergic functions. Onset has been temporally related to viral syndromes in 20% of cases, with autonomic deficits usually evolving over 1 to 3 weeks. Gastroparesis (69%) and syncope (12%) are frequent presenting complaints. Spinal fluid protein levels are often (75%) elevated in pandysautonomic subtypes. Prolonged and incomplete recovery is the rule (60%), with persistent gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension.

The magnitude and time course of this response are described for a large number of hypertensive subjects in whom the assessments were performed during ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. In nearly all of the subjects, the physician's visit was accompanied by blood pressure and heart rate increases that peaked within 4 minutes and then declined. The response was characterized by a relatively high average value; a large between-subject variability; no relation with patient age, baseline hemodynamic values, and responses to laboratory stressors; and no attenuation with multiple repetition of the physician's visit. On the other hand, the increase in blood pressure was considerably less when blood pressure assessment was made by a nurse than when it was made by a physician; in both instances, a 10-minute wait was associated with marked reduction of the initial response. Thus, the stress inherent in usual blood pressure-measuring procedures is responsible for considerable overestimations of patients' blood pressures. There are means by which this can be minimized, although a residual error is likely to remain in most subjects. Whether the stress-devoid blood pressure is a better prognostic index than the stress-related one remains unknown. \",\n",

We also surveyed all anaesthetists in three major hospitals to ascertain their techniques for this method of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced in all patients with thiopentone and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. The first group received 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide as carrier gases, a second group a few normal breaths of 100% oxygen during thiopentone administration followed by 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide, while a third group received 100% oxygen after loss of eyelash reflex until spontaneous breathing was established. No patient received positive pressure ventilation before spontaneous breathing was established. Six of the 10 patients in the first group became hypoxaemic compared to none in the second group, and three patients became hypoxaemic in the third group. Thirty-seven percent of anaesthetists who responded to the survey either did not apply positive pressure ventilation before establishment of spontaneous breathing, or only did so if apnoea was prolonged.

Of the six patients in the series, two had a pituitary adenoma and one each had a metastatic melanoma, multiple myeloma, craniopharyngioma, and lymphoepithelioma. Visual acuity in the affected eyes ranged from 20/25 to no light perception. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed sellar and parasellar recurrence of both pituitary adenomas, but the intrinsic lesions of the optic nerves and optic chiasm induced by radiation were enhanced after gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) administration and were clearly distinguishable from the suprasellar compression of tumor. Repeated MR imaging showed spontaneous resolution of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement of the optic nerve in a patient who was initially suspected of harboring recurrence of a metastatic malignant melanoma as the cause of visual loss. The authors found the presumptive diagnosis of radiation-induced optic neuropathy facilitated by MR imaging with gadolinium-DTPA.

To determine whether detection of antiplatelet autoantibodies (AAb) to glycoproteins IIb/IIIa and Ib/IX may be useful in defining different forms of chronic thrombocytopenic purpura (TP) in children, we analyzed for AAb the platelet and plasma samples from 36 children with chronic TP (mean duration 4.4 years), from 31 children with normal platelet counts at the time of blood sampling but with chronic TP in the past (mean duration 2.9 years), and from 23 adults with chronic TP; the results were correlated with the clinical data. Antiplatelet autoantibodies were detected in 26 (72.2%) of 36 children with ongoing TP, 15 (48.4%) of 31 children with TP in the past, and 12 (66.7%) of 18 adults with TP. All children with high AAb ratios (greater than 5 times the control mean + 3 SD) were more than 8 years of age at diagnosis (mean age 12.4 years compared with 7.1 years in children with moderate or negative AAb levels; p = 0.003). The results suggest that the outcome for adolescents with high platelet-associated AAb levels may be similar to that of adults, whereas younger children may have a greater chance of spontaneous remission. The children with chronic TP in the past and elevated platelet-associated AAb levels may have a \"compensated\" TP and therefore may be at risk for relapses. Future studies aimed at serial AAb determination throughout the patients\\' courses may further define TP subgroups. ',\n",

Mechanisms of the putative antineoplastic effects by beta-carotene are unknown but may involve modulation of the immune system. We measured plasma carotenoid concentrations and selected immunologic indices at baseline and at 2 and 4 wk in 50 healthy humans (5 groups of 10 each) ingesting 0, 15, 45, 180, or 300 mg beta-carotene/d for 1 mo in this randomized placebo-controlled, open-label, parallel study. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations were markedly increased by 2 wk and were correlated with dose. Beta-carotene concentrations plateaued between 2 and 4 wk except for the 300-mg group. Thus, we developed a dose-concentration curve to optimize beta-carotene-dose selection to achieve target plasma concentrations. We were unable to identify any effects of beta-carotene ingestion on the immunologic indices studied, but modest increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in all beta-carotene-treated groups. \",\n",

The natural history of CAD in insulin-dependent (ID) and noninsulin-dependent (NID) diabetes mellitus (DM) is reviewed to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of premature or accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. In both IDDM and NIDDM, the risk of CAD increases with lengthening duration of diabetes; the risk, however, does not grow as a constant multiple of the nondiabetic risk of CAD, suggesting that the cumulative exposure to diabetes plays a significant role as a risk factor for CAD only in a subset of patients. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the diabetic milieu has an impact on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions but not on their initiation. This hypothesis is corroborated further by the observation that CAD does not occur in diabetic patients in populations with a low risk of CAD among nondiabetic patients. The component of the diabetic milieu responsible for promotion of atherosclerotic lesions is unknown. There is evidence, however, of a direct or indirect role of hyperinsulinemia in this process.

Secondary bone grafting of the maxilla in the mixed transitional dentition stage has become a well-accepted procedure in the surgical protocol for rehabilitation of patients with residual alveolar clefts. This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the long-term results obtained with iliac or cranial cancellous bone graft material in the area of alveolar clefts and was based on the independent experience of two plastic surgeons from the same center using exclusively cranial or iliac cancellous bone, respectively. The criteria for surgery were similar. The surgical technique, with the exception of the bone-grafting material, also was similar, and all patients were treated by the same group of orthodontists. Fifteen patients from each group, from a total of over 100 patients, were randomly selected and included in the study. All patients were followed up from 18 to 60 months. Operative and perioperative parameters, donor-site morbidity, and long-term results were evaluated, compared, and analyzed. There were no significant differences between the two groups, and equally good results in terms of bone incorporation, tooth eruption, and appearance were obtained with both iliac and cranial bone grafts. We conclude from our study that successful bone grafting is primarily achieved by adherence to meticulous surgical technique, simultaneous closure of coexisting oronasal or palatal fistulae, use of cancellous bone particles only, and coverage of the grafts with well-vascularized flaps. The source of bone graft does not seem to primarily influence the success of the outcome. ',\n",

The programmed onset of myocardial dysfunction and its progression to congestive heart failure in the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster is hallmarked by alterations in myocellular calcium regulation. To determine whether calcium channel blockade is effective in halting the progressive depression of myocardial contractile performance in this animal model of congestive heart failure, oral verapamil therapy was instituted at 50 days of age, and treatment continued for various durations until the time of study at either 150 or 250 days of age. Left ventricular papillary muscle isometric and isotonic performance, as well as transmembrane electrical characteristics, was depressed in diseased hamsters at 150 days of age and deteriorated further by 250 days of age. These changes were evidenced by prolongation of contraction duration, a marked depression in the load-velocity relation, and a significant prolongation in the repolarization phase of the transmembrane action potential. Myocardial functional and electrical alterations associated with the progression of life in myopathic hamsters were completely halted by verapamil therapy that was continuous from 50 days after birth until death by diastolic arrest, at 150 or 250 days of age. However, premature termination of verapamil treatment before death resulted in a progressive renewal of the functional and electrical alterations for the duration of drug termination. It is concluded that the pathological changes seen during the lifetime of the cardiomyopathic hamster can be prevented by continuous calcium channel blockade and that intermediate prevention can be attained by protracted verapamil therapy. Thus, chronic verapamil therapy may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of human congestive heart failure of similar etiology. ',\n",

The highest incidence of remote neuromuscular disorders in cancer has previously been reported in lung carcinoma. The clinical incidence of neuromuscular disorder was estimated and correlated with muscle histology and the histological type of lung tumour in 100 patients with lung carcinoma who were studied prospectively. Thirty-five patients had small cell carcinoma and 65 patients non-small cell lung cancer. Clinically, 33 patients had a polymyopathy, of whom 18 had a cachectic myopathy and 15 had a proximal myopathy (two patients had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one presented with dermatomyositis and one had evidence of ectopic ACTH production). Cachexia was more common in non-small cell cancer; proximal myopathy was more common in small cell cancer. Ninety-nine patients had abnormal muscle histology; 74 had type II atrophy, 12 had type I and II atrophy, one had type I atrophy and 12 had necrosis. The majority of patients were affected sub-clinically and the clinical entities of cachectic and proximal myopathy did not correspond to previous pathological classifications. Atrophy was not related to the duration of tumour symptoms, ageing, clinical type of myopathy or histological type of lung tumour, and was statistically different from that seen in controls. Qualitatively, the presence of weight loss, muscle wasting and metastatic disease were not factors in the development of atrophy. Similarly, necrosis was not related to the type of lung tumour, the presence of metastases, ageing, weight loss, muscle wasting, duration of tumour symptoms or the clinical form of myopathy. This study demonstrates that lung carcinoma has a direct effect on the motor unit, including atrophy, a necrobiotic myopathy and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Clinical assessment does not accurately assess the 'remote' neuromuscular effects of cancer on the motor unit. \",\n",

Merkel cells are clear oval cells in the epidermis and outer root sheaths of hair follicles, which are probably of epithelial origin, share ultrastructural features with neuroendocrine cells, and are found in association with touch receptors. In the eyelid, they occur singly in the epidermis and external root sheaths of hairs and eyelashes, and in specialized touch spots alternating with eyelashes. Their typical electron microscopical and antigenic features include dense-core granules, intranuclear rodlets, spinous processes, and a positive reaction for specific cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and synaptophysin. Merkel cell carcinoma probably develops from precursor cells which give rise to keratinocytes and Merkel cells, and nearly one out of ten Merkel cell carcinomas occur in the eyelid and periocular region. They tend to be bulging lesions near the lid margin of elderly patients, reddish in color, and erythematous with telangiectatic vessels. The diagnosis is based on the frequent presence of neurofilaments and paranuclear aggregates of intermediate filaments in addition to features typical of normal Merkel cells. The tumor often mimics lymphoma or undifferentiated carcinoma and frequently invades lymphatic vessels. One third of Merkel cell carcinomas recur, almost two thirds give rise to regional node metastases, and up to one half metastasize widely and result in death. Initial treatment should be prompt and aggressive, with wide resection and routine postoperative irradiation. Although metastatic lesions often respond to radiation therapy and cytostatic drugs, these treatments are mainly of palliative value. ',\n",

DESIGN: Arterial oxygen saturation was measured (1) prior to the procedure to provide a baseline value, (2) when the bronchoscope was positioned in the nasopharynx, and (3) when the bronchoscope was positioned in the mid-trachea. SETTING: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in the Pediatric Special Care Unit or in the Pediatric Pulmonary Laboratory using an Olympus BF3C4 fiberoptic bronchoscope with a 3.5-mm outer diameter. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six children who underwent diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy for a variety of reasons were evaluated. They ranged in age from 6 to 142 months; 20 were male and 16 were female. INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the 36 patients, 29 experienced a fall in SaO2 levels exceeding 5 percent of baseline values. The youngest age group, 6 to 12 months, showed the greatest drop in saturation as compared with the other groups. Desaturation was significantly increased by midtracheal FB. CONCLUSIONS: A decline in arterial oxygen saturation that may be substantial in infants and children undergoing FB examination was frequently noted, especially in smaller infants and when the bronchoscope was positioned in the mid-trachea. Supplemental oxygen and a brisk procedure time will minimize the risk of dangerous hypoxia. ',\n",

More than 50% of the United Kingdom patients had high IgG responses in ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia. A confirmatory ELISA showed that the British sera reacted specifically to bovine serum proteins rather than to protozoal antigens. Prior incubation of sera with 5% bovine serum prohibited this reaction. Bovine serum is an integral part of the crude soluble antigen used in most ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia and needs to be replaced with purified antigen preparations. The British sera also reacted to other commonly used blocking agents such as bovine serum albumin, casein, and normal sheep serum. These reactions were attributed to uptake of dietary antigens or an enhanced immunological response to these antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. \",\n",

One hundred AKFP bypasses were done with PTFE and 100 with dacron. In the 30 day postoperative period, four PTFE and three dacron grafts occluded without consequence and only one patient died. Analysis of results by the life-table method demonstrated statistically similar primary graft patency rates at five years (PTFE 65% SE +/- 6.5, dacron 57% +/- 6.2) and ten years (PTFE 31% +/- 18/9, dacron 32% +/- 13.2) (p greater than 0.10). Redo procedures (e.g., thrombectomy, angioplasty) were necessary on 21 grafts (12 PTFE, 9 dacron) and \"secondary\" patency rates at five years were 76% PTFE and 62% dacron; no grafts which required a redo procedure were patent at ten year follow-up. Major amputations during ten year follow-up were necessary in 16 (8%) patients; all amputations were in diabetic patients. Survival rates were 79% at five and 42% at ten years. An anticipated, the leading cause of death was cardiac related (25 patients); 28 (14%) patients underwent aortocoronary bypass during follow-up.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can be used in less certain cases to confirm the presence of common bile duct stones. Because of the absence of an agent that can abort progression of the disease, therapy should consist of adequate resuscitation, nutritional support, and careful monitoring to detect early complications. In patients with mild pancreatitis, surgery usually can be performed within 48 or 72 hours of admission or as soon as symptoms and amylase levels return to normal. For patients with severe disease, endoscopic sphincterotomy is emerging as the therapeutic modality of choice.

Impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling at rest is frequently observed in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who have normal LV systolic function and no previous infarction. To test the hypothesis that abnormal diastolic function at rest might reflect the functional severity of CAD, as estimated by exercise-induced ischemia, the relation between regional and global LV diastolic function at rest and during exercise-induced ischemia was evaluated in 49 patients with radionuclide angiography. All patients had normal systolic function at rest. Group 1 (n = 26) patients manifested a normal ejection fraction response to exercise and group 2 (n = 23) patients an abnormal response. Data obtained from 22 age-comparable normal volunteers were used for comparison. Although regional and global diastolic function were not different between normal subjects and group 1 patients, peak filling rate was lower in group 2 patients than in normal subjects (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic counts/s; p less than 0.01).

Our results indicate that: 1) HBV-infected subjects who develop a self-limited acute hepatitis show a vigorous PBMC response to hepatitis B core Ag and HBeAg, as expression of T cell activation; 2) appearance of a detectable lymphocyte response to HBV nucleocapsid Ag is temporally associated with the clearance of HBV envelope Ag; 3) in patients with chronic HBV infection the level of T cell responsiveness to hepatitis B core Ag and to HBeAg is significantly lower than that observed during acute infection; 4) T cell sensitization to HBV envelope Ag in acute and chronic HBV infection is usually undetectable and when measurable is expressed transiently and at low levels.

The risk of EPI cardiotoxicity at the present schedule is considerable at doses above 1,000 mg/m2. At doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2 the risk of CHF decreases, and at doses below 500 mg/m2, it is negligible. For all patients, the prevalence of CHF was 6% and the sensitivity of LVEF high (95%), mainly due to the low incidence of CHF. Among the 20 patients who received EPI at more than 1,000 mg/m2, the prevalence of CHF was 35% and the sensitivity only 64%. The specificity was maximally 62%.

A case of skin necrosis in a patient receiving intravenous (IV) heparin during routine intermittent hemodialysis is reported. Multiple erythematous, tender lesions developed over the abdomen and thighs and rapidly became necrotic. Biopsies showed fibrin thrombi in the dermal venules and capillaries, but no cellular infiltrate. The patient was in her third month of regular hemodialysis. Skin necrosis associated with the use of heparin usually occurs within 2 weeks of beginning heparin therapy and has not been reported in patients receiving heparin with hemodialysis.

Fourty-four unselected patients with noncardiac chest pain were studied using conventional manometry with additional edrophonium provocation and 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH and pressure recording with a system developed by our group. New, fully automated techniques of statistical analysis of the complete set of esophageal pressure and pH signals were used to examine the temporal relation between pain, esophageal motility disturbances, and gastroesophageal reflux. The analysis used the 97.5th percentile of amplitude and duration of all esophageal contractions in each patient as well as a chi 2 test of the distribution of contraction types to determine whether a pain episode was related to abnormal motility or not. The edrophonium test results were positive in 2 patients. Only 25 patients (56.8%) had at least one pain episode (total, 111 episodes) during 24-hour recording. Thirty-three percent of the pain episodes were related to reflux and 23.4% to abnormal motility, and 43.2% were not related to an esophageal function disturbance. In the patient-oriented analysis in this study, it was required for a positive correlation that the symptom index (percentage of related pain episodes) was higher than 75%. It was found that the pain was related to reflux in 2 patients (4.6%), to reflux and motor abnormalities in 4 (9.2%), and to motor abnormalities in 2 patients (4.6%). In 36 patients (81.8%), no relation with an esophageal abnormality could be established, either because the patients had no pain during the 24-hour study, or because the pain seemed unrelated to reflux or abnormal motility.

One hundred twenty-two children with nonmetastatic osteogenic or Ewing's sarcoma were studied to assess the effect of multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy on skeletal growth and final stature. No deviations from the height distributions of a normal population were noted at diagnosis. There was a marked retardation of linear growth during the year of intensive chemotherapy. Only 15% of the patients grew at the expected rate during that year. The distribution of nutritional status scores was significantly different at the end of the first year than at baseline. The distribution of ultimate height scores was significantly different than the baseline distribution. The overall final distribution was also significantly different from the normal population expectation. Any absolute difference in height, however, is likely to be small.

We analyzed the effect of Aspirin on the growth of experimentally induced vascular thickenings in rat carotid arteries. Vascular thickenings were induced by denudation of the endothelium in the left carotid artery with a balloon catheter. Administration of Aspirin-rich food (17.4 g/kg body wt/day) was started 1 week before and continued 2 weeks after injury. Nine rats were used. A control group of equal size received normal food. Sizes of the tunica media, the neointima, and the open vessel lumen were measured on cross sections of carotid segments with the aid of a videomorphometry system. The results show that in the Aspirin group, neointimal lesions are significantly smaller than in the control group (0.14 mm2 versus 0.23 mm2; p less than 0.5). Thickenings of the tunica media are also reduced (0.11 mm2 versus 0.12 mm2; p less than 0.5).

We tested whether vitreoperfusion, a new method of perfusing the vitreous cavity with solutions containing nutrients, can limit retinal injury if initiated after the onset of ischemia. Severe bilateral ocular ischemia was induced in cats with healed lensectomy-vitrectomy wounds; 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes later, one eye from each of 18 cats underwent vitreoperfusion while the ischemia continued for 120 minutes. The other eye simultaneously underwent either continued untreated ischemia or reinstated circulation. The histopathologic abnormalities evident after 8 days depended on the duration of ischemia. Reinstated circulation yielded less retinal damage than continued ischemia. Nine additional cats underwent bilateral ischemia for at least 210 minutes. Vitreoperfusion was initiated in one eye after 30 minutes. In each cat, the vitreoperfused eye fared significantly better as observed histopathologically and electroretinographically. We believe that no other treatment has similarly limited retinal injury in vivo when initiated so long after total ocular ischemia has developed. ',\n",

One of the most severe complications of laparoscopic tubal sterilization is bowel burns, although they often go undetected at the time of laparoscopy. Controversy remains over whether these injuries are caused directly by operator error or indirectly from a hot oviduct's or instrument's inadvertently touching and burning the intestine. A study was performed to determine the potential for direct or indirect bowel burns using bipolar electrocoagulation in rabbits. The results indicate that neither a hot tube nor hot (recently used) forceps could cause injuries to the serosal surface of the intestine. That was true both of immediate injury and after one to five days of recovery. It was observed that the hot uterine tube caused significant bowel adhesions by five days after the procedure. Direct electrocoagulation of the bowel using 40 W for three seconds caused a minor, noticeable blanch on the bowel that was not detectable with gross or histologic means after one day of recovery. A direct bowel injury did result when 80 W was used for three seconds; the bowel became perforated after one day. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that one can produce a bowel burn indirectly from a hot uterine tube or instrument and that only a direct insult to the bowel appears to cause an injury. However, adhesions could be a complication of the procedure and should be considered. \",\n",

In this study, ratios of both the serum alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase were constructed to evaluate their usefulness in differentiating fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease (n = 6) from other etiologies (n = 43). An analysis of the data showed that cutoff values of less than 2.0 for the alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio and greater than 4.0 for the aspartate transaminase ratio were associated with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease only (P less than 0.001).

To investigate the influence of orifice geometry on the three-dimensional shape of jets, an in vitro Doppler color flow study was performed. Jets were formed by discharging blood through round orifices and through orifices with major/minor axis ratios of 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1. These were repeated with orifice areas of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 cm2. For turbulent and laminar jets formed by these orifices, Doppler color flow images were obtained from two orthogonal scanning planes aligned with the major and minor orifice axes. Jet width was measured at 1 cm intervals from 0 to 5 cm from the orifice and used to calculate jet eccentricity (ratio of major to minor axis widths) and the rate of divergence of the jet walls. Jets were observed to diverge more rapidly along walls aligned with the orifice minor axis rather than along the major axis. This differential spreading led to the development of circular symmetry at a short distance from the orifice. Jet divergence (theta) occurred more rapidly for turbulent jets and for jets formed by larger orifices: theta (zero) = 0.80 + 6.3.A + 7.0.T + 0.47.E-OR (r = 95, p less than 0.0001, n = 48), where A is orifice area (cm2); T is 0 for laminar jets, 1 for turbulent jets and E-OR combines orifice eccentricity and scanning orientation, ranging from -5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the major axis, 0 for circular orifices to 5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the minor axis. Within the jet, eccentricity decayed approximately exponentially with distance from the orifice, more rapidly for turbulent jets, more slowly for the larger and more eccentric orifices. ',\n",

A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome similar to those described in Drosophila melanogaster occurs in Drosophila virilis when a laboratory stock is crossed to a wild strain collected in the Batumi region of Georgia (U.S.S.R). Mutations in various loci obtained during these crosses are presumably induced by the insertion of DNA sequences. We have cloned an induced white mutation and characterized the insertion sequence responsible for the mutant phenotype. This sequence is a 10.6-kilobase (kb) transposable element we have named Ulysses. This element is flanked by unusually large 2.1-kb long terminal repeats. Ulysses also contains other landmarks characteristic of the retrotransposon family, such as a tRNA-binding site adjacent to the 5' long terminal repeat and open reading frames encoding putative products with homology to the reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase domains typical of proteins encoded by vertebrate retroviruses. Some of the mutations obtained do not contain a copy of the Ulysses element at the mutant locus, suggesting that a different transposable element may be responsible for the mutation. Therefore, Ulysses may not be the primary cause of the entire dysgenic syndrome, and its mobilization may be the result of activation by an independent mobile element. \",\n",

To evaluate usefulness and limitations of proximal jet dimensions for the quantitation of valvular regurgitation, fluid jets were created in a pulsatile flow model, and proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were measured by means of color Doppler flow imaging. When circular orifices with diameters from 1 to 6 mm were studied, jet width and cross-sectional jet area measured as close as possible to the orifice were directly related to the orifice diameter (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 0.4 mm; y = 0.5 + 0.97x) and the orifice area (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 5.7 mm2; y = 0.22 + 2.47x), respectively. No significant dependence on flow rate or pressure gradient was found for these measurements. Jet width was measured with color M-mode Doppler by use of the smallest sample volume size (1 mm) and was slightly greater than the orifice diameter (4.2 +/- 1.7 mm versus 3.8 +/- 1.7 mm). However, cross-sectional areas were approximately fourfold the orifice areas, on average (52.5 +/- 24.6 mm2 versus 12.3 +/- 9.7 mm2), with a range of twelvefold (smallest orifice) to threefold (largest orifice). When the sample volume size was reduced from 2.4 to 1.0 mm, color areas decreased by 25.6 +/- 6.0%. Slit-shaped orifices were studied with two different orientations of the slit-parallel and perpendicular to the ultrasound beam: Color M-mode measurements were again slightly greater than length and width of the slit, but cross-sectional areas were substantially larger than the orifice areas and increased between 44% and 115% when changing the orientation of the slit from perpendicular to parallel. This, again, reflected problems with lateral resolution. When cross-sectional areas were measured at increasing distances from the orifice, the cross-sectional jet area increased significantly within a few millimeters. This increase was greater with higher gradients and smaller orifice sizes. In case of a small orifice (2 mm) and a high gradient (130 to 160 mm Hg), increase in area was as great as 122% within a distance of only 5 mm. Thus, proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were directly related to the orifice size, which could be a valuable parameter for the evaluation of valvular regurgitation. Measurements of jet width by color M-mode seemed to be most accurate but are limited by the fact that in vivo valvular defects may be irregular rather than of circular shape.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

Interferons and interferon induction can inhibit cytochromes P-450 and reduce the bioactivation and hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. However, since P-450 inhibition often is followed by P-450 induction, which would enhance acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, the possibility of a biphasic modulation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by interferons was investigated. Outbred male CD-1 mice of various ages, and young inbred male C57BL/6 mice were given the interferon inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I-C), 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, followed 1 to 48 days later by a single dose of acetaminophen, 300 to 450 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by the peak plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurring between 0 and 48 hr after acetaminophen treatment. Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen given within 8 days, with maximal inhibition between 1 and 4 days. Conversely, a maximal 7-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed in CD-1 mice when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 32 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). In the C57BL/6 strain, Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen when given within 16 days, whereas a maximal 20-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 24 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). The mechanism of toxicologic enhancement was examined in male C57BL/6 mice using the same treatment regimen. Biochemical assessment of hepatotoxicity was confirmed by detailed histologic evaluation. Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Acetaminophen bioactivation was quantified by production of the glutathione-derived cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates of acetaminophen. Poly I-C pretreatment produced a 5-fold increase in acetaminophen-induced ALT release (P less than 0.05), which correlated with histologic evidence of centrilobular necrosis. Poly I-C pretreatment produced respective 3-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the production of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates (P less than 0.05), which correlated with peak ALT concentrations (cysteine, r = 0.92, P less than 0.001; mercapturic acid, r = 0.75, P = 0.006). Thus, the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen can be inhibited when given within days after interferon induction, and conversely enhanced when given after several weeks. The toxicologic enhancement appears to be due to increased P-450-catalyzed bioactivation of acetaminophen. ',\n",

All were assessed prospectively to be at risk neurodevelopmental delay. This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus thrombosis (n = 20). The signal intensities of hemorrhage underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of hemorrhage for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of hemorrhage for up to 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of onset of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral hemorrhage; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7. Short-term neurological abnormality was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project.

The four transvenous defibrillation techniques were 1) single pathway monophasic pulsing, 2) single pathway biphasic pulsing, 3) dual pathway sequential pulsing, and 4) dual pathway simultaneous pulsing. A transvenous defibrillation method was considered to be potentially useful only if the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 500 V (less than or equal to 15 J delivered energy). The 500 V value would allow a 2:1 defibrillation safety margin for a device with a maximal output of 30 J. No single transvenous pulsing technique was uniformly superior in efficacy. However, by choosing the best pulsing technique for each patient, it was possible to obtain an average defibrillation threshold of 410 +/- 135 V leading edge voltage, 7.2 +/- 2.5 A leading edge current and 11.3 +/- 7.4 J delivered energy for the group of 12 patients. With the ability to vary defibrillation technique, transvenous antiarrhythmic device implantation would have been possible in 10 (83%) of the 12 patients at or below a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point. In contrast, if only one transvenous defibrillation method had been used, as few as 5 and at most 8 of the 12 patients would have been candidates for a transvenous defibrillation system given a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point for insertion.

The carcinoma was resistant to treatment, and he died of complications related to metastatic disease 3 years posttransplantation. Molecular biologic studies using nonisotopic-labeled viral DNA probes were done. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of HPV 16 DNA in the tumor cells. DNA dot blot analysis confirmed the presence of multiple copies of HPV 16 DNA within the tumor cells and their absence from adjacent normal-appearing tissue. Southern blot analysis suggested that the HPV 16 DNA was integrated into the tumor cell genome.

Furthermore, red blood cell polyamine level determination discriminated patients in the hormonal escape group (group 4) from those usually considered as hormone responsive (groups 2 and 3). No statistically significant correlation was observed between red blood cell polyamine levels and usual tumor markers (prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate specific antigen).

A variant of hepatorenal syndrome occurring in patients with chronic congestive heart failure following an episode of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in the absence of hypotension, is described. This was observed in 13 patients during an eleven-year period. The clinical picture is characterized by hepatic injury and functional renal impairment. Increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels as high as 2100 IU; prolongation of prothrombin time; elevation of serum bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; decrease in urinary sodium excretion; and a normal urinary sediment are the salient laboratory abnormalities of this entity. Treated with conventional medication, the patients' course was fatal in 4 cases. When the splanchnic vasodilator dopamine was added to the patients' management, 5 of 9 patients recovered. Cardiogenic hepatorenal syndrome is a severe but potentially reversible complication of heart failure. The apparently beneficial effect of low-dose dopamine needs further evaluation. \",\n",

The complex gestational age dependent pattern of postnatal prolactin release has been defined and reference standards provided. Plasma prolactin was higher in girls, with increasing divergence between the sexes from the third week onwards, and higher after two weeks, in infants of mothers with pregnancy related hypertension. Diet, assigned randomly, exerted a major effect on plasma prolactin, with significantly higher values in infants fed donor breast milk or standard formula than in those fed a protein, energy, and mineral enriched preterm formula. After adjusting for confounding factors, infants with the lowest plasma prolactin concentrations (less than 1000 mU/l, 32.9 micrograms/l) occurring usually at a nadir between days 5 and 12, showed a 120% increase in the duration of ventilatory assistance required, a 20% increase in the number of days to attain full enteral feeds, and a 30% decrease in length gain. We suggest preterm birth disrupts the normal perinatal pattern of prolactin release and that those infants who develop relatively low plasma concentration have an adverse outcome. Our data add to the broader debate on whether preterm infants require multiple endocrine replacement treatment. ',\n",

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has rapidly emerged as a popular alternative to traditional laparotomy and cholecystectomy. Acute cholecystitis has been considered to be a relative or absolute contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. After gaining extensive experience in laparoscopic biliary tract surgery, this procedure was attempted in 15 patients with acute cholecystitis. All patients were operated on within 72 hours of admission. In five patients, the laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open laparotomy; in one patient, a localized abscess was found, and in the other four patients, extensive inflammation and edema precluded a safe dissection of the vascular and ductal structures. Laparoscopic cholangiography was performed in 14 patients and proved valuable in demonstrating the ductal anatomy. Patients were discharged an average of 2.7 days after the laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be safely performed by experienced surgeons in patients with acute cholecystitis. To ensure a low complication rate, a low threshold for converting the procedure to an open laparotomy must be maintained if the ductal and vascular anatomy cannot be safely demonstrated. ',\n",

This article explores the hypothesis that migraine with aura is associated with a state of central neuronal hyperexcitability. The authors propose that this central neuronal hyperexcitability involves overactivity of the excitatory amino acids, glutamate, and possibly aspartate. Stimuli that activate the migraine attack evoke neuronal depolarization, slow depolarization shifts, and spreading suppression of spontaneous neuronal activity possible by glutamate and K+ dependent mechanisms. A low brain Mg2+ and consequent reduced gating of glutamatergic receptors may provide the link between the physiologic threshold for a migraine attack and the mechanisms of the attack itself by promoting glutamate hyperactivity, neuronal hyperexcitability, and susceptibility to glutamate-dependent spreading depression.

This study evaluated the effect of bilateral carotid chemodenervation on the cerebrovascular response to hypoxia in conscious rats. Cerebral blood flow was measured using 4-iodo[N-methyl-14C]antipyrine, and the total and perfused microvasculature was studied by injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran and alkaline phosphatase staining. To maintain constant PCO2, hypoxia was achieved in chemoreceptor-intact rats by the use of 4% CO2-8% O2-88% N2 and in chemodenervated rats by the administration of 8% O2-92% N2. Blood gas and hemodynamic parameters were similar in the two groups of rats. Chemodenervation had no significant effect on either resting blood flow or the perfused microvasculature during normoxia. A significant increase in cerebral blood flow (from 71 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g in control and from 91 +/- 5 to 127 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g in chemodenervated rats) and in the percent of cerebral arterioles and capillaries perfused occurred in both hypoxic control and chemodenervated rats. In chemoreceptor-intact rats, the greatest increase in blood flow and in perfused microvasculature occurred in caudal structures (medulla and pons) in comparison with rostral structures (cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus). In chemodenervated rats, a similar increase in blood flow and perfused microvasculature occurred in all brain regions, with no regional differences. Thus, chemodenervation did not affect the overall cerebral blood flow or the microvascular response to hypoxia; however, rostral-to-caudal regional differences in the hypoxic response were lost after chemodenervation.

We investigated the effects of energy restriction on the pituitary-ovarian axis and on a hormone responsive gene, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Female C3H/SHN F1-hybrid mice, known to display a high incidence of mammary tumors, ate an energy-restricted diet (48 kcal/wk) or a control diet (95 kcal/wk) beginning at the time of weaning. By 67 wk of age, 12 of 32 mice in the control group, but none of the 33 mice in the energy-restricted group, had developed mammary tumors. Six tumor-free mice from each group were studied in detail at 67 wk of age. All six tumor-free control mice, but none of the six energy-restricted mice, showed uterine endometrial hyperplasia at autopsy. Mice subjected to energy restriction did not display an estrous cycle. The average levels of MMTV mRNA in mammary glands and uteri were strongly reduced by energy restriction. MMTV mRNA levels in mammary glands from control mice were two orders of magnitude lower than those in mammary tumors. Energy restriction lowered the percentage of pituitary mammatropes and suppressed proliferation of mammatropes with advancing age. Energy restriction thus appeared to inhibit endometrial hyperplasia and to decrease MMTV production at the mRNA level in the mammary glands and in the uterus. These effects may be a consequence of hormonal changes originating at the pituitary-ovarian axis. ',\n",

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer. Preferential retention of the photosensitizer by malignant tissue has been considered a hallmark of this treatment modality. However, photosensitivity can be observed in normal, non-neoplastic tissues, and the present study investigated the effects of PDT treatment on the abdomen of intact rats. A circular region (1 cm diameter) on the shaved abdomen of Fischer rats, pretreated 24 h prior with Photofrin II, was irradiated for 30 min at 632 nm. Control animals received either photoradiation or Photofrin II administration. Subsequent lesions were observed in the irradiated skin, its associated abdominal wall, and the underlying gut in rats receiving Photofrin II and laser irradiation. All tissues were not equally sensitive to PDT treatment. Gut lesions were consistently more severe than were skin and abdominal wall injuries. By 24 hr after treatment, the gut manifested a transmural hemorrhagic necrosis, while the irradiated skin and abdominal wall were edematous, with an inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis and around occasional swollen myocytes. These results indicate that superficial lesions induced by PDT may not be reliable indicators of the extent of deeper PDT tissue damage. Further, it may be possible to take advantage of this discrepancy in tissue sensitivity and treat deep tissues through less sensitive superficial tissues. ',\n",

Abnormalities in the fast Fourier transforms of signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained during sinus rhythm appear to distinguish patients with ischemic heart disease and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from those without ventricular tachycardia. This study was performed to determine the power of frequency analysis to detect patients with a history of ventricular fibrillation, to determine the extent to which spectra of signal-averaged ECGs from patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease are comparable and to compare results of signal-averaged ECG analysis in patients with ventricular fibrillation with results of programmed ventricular stimulation. Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with ventricular fibrillation (Group II). Results of signal-averaged ECG analysis were abnormal in 92% of patients with ventricular tachycardia and 85% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS). Abnormal spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90% of patients with ischemic and from 86% of patients with nonischemic heart disease (p = NS). In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly between the two patient groups. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 91% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared with only 46% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.0001). Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81% of patients with ischemic heart disease compared with only 50% of those with nonischemic heart disease (p less than 0.02). Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with ventricular fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose arrhythmia was not inducible by programmed stimulation. These results broaden the potential clinical application of noninvasive interrogation of signal-averaged ECGs to include the prospective identification of patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

Whether parenchymal or nonparenchymal liver cells play a predominant role in the pathophysiology of hepatic fibrosis has not been firmly established in vivo. We have addressed this question by quantitating the relative abundance of specific mRNAs for collagen types I, III, and IV, and laminin in purified populations of hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and lipocytes from normal and fibrotic rat liver. In normal liver, type I collagen gene expression was minimal in all cell types; mRNA for types III and IV collagen were apparent in endothelial cells and lipocytes, but not in hepatocytes. Laminin mRNA was present in all cell types. Induction of fibrogenesis by either bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration was associated with a substantial increase in mRNA for types I and III collagen in nonparenchymal cells. Lipocytes from fibrotic animals exhibited a greater than 30-fold increase in type I collagen mRNA relative to normal lipocytes, and greater than 40-fold relative to hepatocytes. Type III collagen mRNA reached 5 times that in normal lipocytes and greater than 120 times that in hepatocytes. Endothelial cells exhibited an isolated increase in type I collagen mRNA, reaching five times that in normal liver. Type IV collagen and laminin gene expression were not significantly increased in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis; in fact, mRNA for type IV collagen and laminin decreased by up to 50% in endothelial cells. Despite the pronounced changes that occurred in matrix gene expression in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis, no change was noted in hepatocytes. We conclude that nonparenchymal liver cells, particularly lipocytes, are important effectors of hepatic fibrosis in vivo. ',\n",

We report here the use of the biochemical marker desialylated transferrin to aid in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial AST to total AST (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81% and 98%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92%; the specificity was only 50%, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives.

The CD45 family contains protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity and is expressed in one or more of its isoforms on all lymphohematopoietic cells. Considerable work has focused on CD45 expression by lymphoid cells, but minimal work has involved granulocytes. Granulocytic, or myeloid, cell differentiation is accompanied by a number of morphologic and immunophenotypic changes. This study used flow cytometric and immunocytochemical methods in conjunction with morphologic assessment to investigate the expression of CD45 isoforms during differentiation of normal and malignant granulocytic cells. On normal bone marrow cells, the quantity of surface CD45 did not change during earlier stages but did increase significantly at the terminal stages (bands and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]). CD45RO (the low relative molecular mass [Mr] isoform) was very dimly expressed on immature cells but became increasingly brighter beginning at approximately the myelocyte stage. The high Mr isoform (CD45RA) was virtually absent from the cell surface at all stages. Only a small percentage (3-15%) of PMNs expressed surface CD45RA. However, there was a cytoplasmic pool of each isoform associated with membrane-bound granules found throughout differentiation, with remarkable increases in expression at the terminal stages. In the case of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), most cases expressed surface CD45RA with, or without, CD45RO, regardless of their French-American-British (FAB) classification. This appeared to be a stable process at diagnosis and relapse in individual patients and may therefore serve as a diagnostic aid. The biologic significance of this aberrant expression of CD45RA by malignant cells is unknown but raises important questions regarding the cellular processes of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in normal and malignant cells.

Many animal and, more recently, clinical studies have begun to delineate the real and potential roles of stents. Although the ideal intravascular stent does not exist, it is possible to identify characteristics of the hypothetical ideal stent. Iliac and femoropopliteal arterial applications of metallic stents are reviewed. Stents have proved useful in postangioplasty elastic recoil, in some cases of postangioplasty restenosis, and in angioplasty-induced dissection. Their role in primary angioplasty procedures is still uncertain, although in iliac angioplasty the immediate hemodynamic effects of angioplasty plus stenting are superior to those of angioplasty alone. It is clear that metallic stents have not solved the problem of postangioplasty restenosis, as restenosis still occurs in a significant number of cases. This problem is particularly evident in the femoropopliteal stent procedures, in which angiographic restenosis (more than 50% single diameter stenosis) at 6 months after treatment has occurred in approximately 30% of cases. The existence of poststenting restenosis, which often involves the stented segment, underscores the need for better drug regimens in angioplasty and for better understanding of the intimal fibrocellular proliferative response of the vessel wall to injury. Although potentially very useful, biodegradable stents are still a dream whose realization will demand the development of better materials. ',\n",

Obstruction is a complication of many esophageal diseases, but the morphological changes occurring in the obstructed esophagus are poorly understood. We developed a model of esophageal obstruction in the American opossum, Didelphis virginiana. A nonconstricting band around the gastroesophageal junction led to esophageal distention and tortuosity in the weeks following its placement. Despite a marked increase of the esophageal circumference, the esophageal wall was not thinned, and the circular muscle layer had actually increased its thickness. This was due to an increase in the size of individual smooth muscle cells with proportional increases in the cell surface area and volume. The electron density of hypertrophic smooth muscle cells varied much more than that of normal esophageal smooth muscle cells. As cell size increased, the tissue became more compact and the size of the extracellular space decreased. Also, the extracellular space was filled by an amorphous electron-dense material. Additional changes in the structure of hypertrophic smooth muscle cells included prominent intermediate filaments in the vicinity of thick filaments. There was no difference in the structure of the hypertrophic smooth muscle at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks after placement of the band. The morphological features described here resemble those seen in human esophageal spasm and achalasia of humans and could affect esophageal smooth muscle function. ',\n",

To assess the validity of this method, the EEGs recorded during 93 episodes of circulatory arrest in ten normothermic, lightly anesthetized patients undergoing implantation of automatic internal cardioverting defibrillators (AICDs) were visually inspected for change. The number of events recorded for each patient varied from 5 to 18 and was a function of the duration and success of AICD testing in each patient. In 82 of 93 (88%) episodes, EEG changes were identified, and occurred an average of 10.2 s after the last normal heart beat. Of these 82, 67 (82%) illustrated slowing and attenuation. However, 15 (18%) of the hemodynamic events showed changes not previously described as indicative of cerebral ischemia: 6 (7%) showed a loss of delta-wave activity and 9 (11%) showed an increase in the amplitude of theta activity. Time to onset of these unusual changes (10.6 and 9.2 s, respectively) was not significantly different from that for EEG slowing and attenuation (10.2 s). Five of the ten subjects showed more than one pattern of EEG change. There was no significant difference in the time to onset of EEG change among individual patients, and neither were there differences in patterns of change associated with particular anesthetic agents. These results indicate that in normothermic, lightly anesthetized individuals, cerebral ischemia may cause changes in EEG pattern other than slowing and attenuation of dominant frequencies. These alternative patterns should be recognized as indicative of cerebral ischemia when intraoperative EEG monitoring is performed. ',\n",

Panic disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis whose main feature is paroxysmal attacks of anxiety that strike suddenly without apparent provocation. Physicians explain the attacks as an ictal phenomenon in patients with known seizures because of their similarities to complex partial seizures. We report eight patients with seizures and panic disorder. Recognition of a second diagnostic entity resulted in a beneficial change in treatment in six of the eight. We did not find an increased incidence of panic disorder in our seizure clinic population as compared with the general population. ',\n",
       " 975: 'T cell recognition of transforming proteins encoded by mutated ras proto-oncogenes. Activated ras proto-oncogenes contribute to the pathogenesis of many animal and human malignancies. ras proto-oncogenes are generally activated by point mutations within codons 12 or 61, which result in the expression of ras protein (p21) bearing characteristic single amino acid substitutions at the corresponding residues. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the presence of single transforming amino acid substitutions can render normal ras protein immunogenic and, thus, a possible target for T cell-mediated tumor therapy. In initial experiments, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 5 through 16 of p21 containing the transforming substitution of arginine for normal glycine at residue 12. The results demonstrated that class II MHC-restricted T cells which were specific for the peptide could be elicited, and that the peptide-induced T cells could specifically recognize the corresponding intact p21 ras protein. Recognition of p21 ras protein by peptide-specific T cells implies that C57BL/6 APC can process the activated ras protein in a fashion that allows presentation of digested protein by class II MHC molecules in a configuration similar to the configuration with synthetic peptide. Evaluation of the immunogenicity of peptides containing alternative transforming amino acid substitutions of ras protein demonstrated that some, but not all, were immunogenic in individual strains of mice. Therefore, although ras protein-specific T cells can be elicited by immunization with synthetic peptides, not all of the potential ras mutations commonly associated with malignancy may be recognizable by T cells from all individuals.

To determine whether patients at risk for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could be detected while in sinus rhythm, the signal-averaged electrocardiogram triggered by P waves was recorded in 42 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Paf group) and in 50 control patients. The root mean square voltages (LP10, LP20, and LP30) for the last 10, 20, and 30 msec and the duration (Ad) of filtered (40-300 Hz) P wave of the spatial magnitude were measured. LP10 and LP20 were significantly lower in the Paf than in the control group (LP10, 1.92 +/- 0.58 versus 2.49 +/- 0.78 microV, p less than 0.001; LP20, 2.47 +/- 0.78 versus 3.46 +/- 1.20 microV, p less than 0.0001), although no significant difference in LP30 was found between groups. Ad was also significantly longer in the Paf than in the control group (137.0 +/- 14.3 versus 118.6 +/- 11.3 msec, p less than 0.001). These differences between the Paf and control groups remained significant even after dividing by the presence or absence of organic heart diseases. The criteria of \"LP20 = 3.5 microV or less\" and \"Ad greater than 120 msec\" as defining \"atrial late potential\" gave a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 76%. These findings suggest that patients at risk for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation could be detected while in sinus rhythm by using the P wave-triggered signal-averaged electrocardiogram. ',\n",

Clonality was determined in female patients by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the X-chromosome genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase and phosphoglycerate kinase in conjunction with their respective methylation patterns. Peripheral lymphocyte DNA was screened from 62 female patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. Eleven patients were heterozygous for the BglI site on PGK, 4 for the BamHI site on HPRT, and 1 patient for both sites. Of these 16 patients, 3 had acromegaly, 4 had Cushing's disease, 7 had hyperprolactinemia, and 2 were clinically nonfunctional. After surgery, morphological study, including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the pathological specimens, allowed a direct comparison between clonality and tumor cell type. Control fresh normal pituitary tissue was found to be polyclonal. The following tumors were monoclonal: all 3 somatotroph adenomas, 4 of 4 lactotroph tumors, 3 of 4 corticotroph cell adenomas, a gonadotroph adenoma, and a nonsecretory adenoma. A mixed plurihormonal adenoma was polyclonal, as were 2 tumors consisting of adenomatous lactotrophs interspersed with nontumorous adenohypophyseal pituitary tissue and one corticotroph adenoma mixed with normal pituitary tissue. Functional pituitary adenomas derived from somatotrophs, corticotrophs, or lactotrophs and nonsecretory tumors are monoclonal in nature, suggesting that somatic cell mutations precede clonal expansion of these cells and play a major role in pituitary tumorigenesis. \",\n",

After withdrawal, colorectal transit time significantly increased from 24.9 +/- 3.6 to 33.3 +/- 4.5 hours mean +/- SE (P less than 0.01). This was the result of an exclusive increase in rectosigmoid transit time from 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.8 +/- 2.1 hours (P less than 0.001). No variations were found in right or left colon transit time.

The main pancreatic duct epithelium acts as a barrier to the diffusion of molecules from the duct lumen into pancreatic acinar and interstitial tissue. We studied sequential ultrastructural characteristics of the loss of epithelial barrier function in the cat using lanthanum, an electron-opaque tracer, following perfusion of the duct from the tail to the duodenum with infected human bile. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells were found to become permeable to the tracer as early as after 15 min of exposure. Later, there was progressive disintegration of intercellular junctions and epithelial loss. Lanthanum penetrated the duct epithelium exclusively on an intercellular path. Loss of barrier function of the pancreatic duct epithelium was consistently associated with subsequent development of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis. There was no association between the degree of duct epithelial damage and the severity of acute pancreatitis. Both bile and a suspension of bacteria alone were not harmful to the pancreas. Sequential perfusion produced acute pancreatitis only when at first bile and then the bacterial suspension was perfused. A reversed succession of perfusates produced no morphologic alterations. We conclude: (1) Increased tight junction permeability is an early lesion in acute bile-induced pancreatitis: (2) loss of duct epithelial barrier function is important for the initiation but not for the severity of the inflammation; and (3) bile renders duct epithelial intercellular junctions vulnerable to Escherichia coli bacteria.

Forty-one patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of unknown etiology were re-investigated at an average of 91 months after the bleed to determine functional capacity. Nineteen patients were performing at their previous level of work, five were employed part-time, and four could not work due to the SAH. Five patients showed a moderate disability in activities of daily living but were not dependent on help, one patient was severely disabled, and two had died. There was one rebleed. Early prognosis of an unfavorable outcome was possible on the basis of three clinical variables on admission: a history of hypertension, a Hunt and Hess grade of greater than II, and the presence of focal neurological deficits. In addition, the presence of an organic mental syndrome at discharge was identified as a predictive factor for reduced functional capacity later on. Other clinical variables in the acute stage, including sex, age, history of headache, interval between SAH and admission, impaired consciousness, and cognitive deficits, were not related to a limited functional level. Residual neurological deficits and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge were also not predictive of restrictions in global functions evaluated by means of the Karnofsky Performance Scale status at follow-up review.

To determine the importance of airway inflammation for the development of late asthmatic reactions, we examined sensitized subjects during late asthmatic reactions induced by exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in the laboratory. Late asthmatic reactions are associated with a transient increase of bronchial responsiveness and, at the same time, with an increase of neutrophils followed by eosinophils, and of LTB4 and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Late asthmatic reactions, increased bronchial responsiveness, and increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, LTB4, and albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage induced by exposure to TDI are all prevented by pretreatment with prednisone but not with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin. Aerosolized steroids (beclomethasone and dexamethasone isonicotinate) completely inhibit late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI, whereas theophylline has a partial, and verapamil, ketotifen, and cromolyn have no protective effect. These results suggest that late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI may be caused by airway inflammation, and that anti-inflammatory steroids should be recommended in the prophylaxis of TDI asthma.

Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects. Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%). These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases). MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases. EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases. Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients. These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization. These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection. These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions. This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development. It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy. \",\n",

Plasma histamine concentrations were measured using a commercially available monoclonal antibody radioimmunoassay in 38 patients with nephrotic syndrome, end stage renal failure, those receiving haemodialysis, and those receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis to determine whether histamine may mediate damage to glomerular capillaries and arterial endothelium. Plasma histamine concentrations were significantly increased in all four patient groups when compared with those of controls and were the highest in two patients with pruritus. Raised plasma histamine concentrations in such patients are consistent with the hypothesis that histamine may contribute to the damage to glomerular capillaries and to arterial endothelium. These effects may be relevant to the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and atherosclerosis. Histamine may also contribute to the pathogenesis of pruritus in patients with chronic renal failure.

The diagnosis and treatment of human fetal defects has evolved rapidly over the past decade due to improved fetal imaging techniques and better understanding of fetal pathophysiology derived from animal models. The detection of a fetal anomaly may now lead to a change in the timing of delivery, a change in the mode of delivery, or prenatal treatment. Because most therapeutic maneuvers involve some risk to the fetus and mother, there must be a reasonable expectation that the procedure is feasible, safe, and effective before it can be attempted in humans. This requires reliable information about the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease process, the efficacy of fetal surgical intervention in ameliorating the disease, and the feasibility and safety of the proposed intervention. This paper focuses on the rationale and initial clinical experience with fetal surgery for a variety of life-threatening fetal anatomic defects. ',\n",

SETTING--A department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen, seeing about half the patients with AIDS in Denmark. SUBJECTS--73 HIV antibody negative subjects and 60 antibody positive subjects admitted as inpatients during the transmission period of the outbreak (20 June-14 August), of whom 18 (17 with AIDS, one with AIDS related complex), developed cryptosporidiosis. Two further HIV negative subjects (one departmental secretary, one visiting relative) developed cryptosporidiosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cryptosporidia in stool samples, clinical symptoms, CD4 cell count, HIV antigen concentration, chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS--The source of the outbreak was identified as ice from an ice machine in the ward, contaminated by an incontinent, psychotic patient with cryptosporidiosis picking out ice for cold drinks. The mean incubation time was at least 13 days-that is, twice that in HIV-negative patients. Of the 18 patients with AIDS who developed cryptosporidiosis, five recovered, two were symptomless carriers, three died of unrelated causes, and eight died after prolonged diarrhoea. Among the 57 exposed HIV antibody positive inpatients (excluding two patients and the index case with cryptosporidiosis diagnosed elsewhere), significantly more of those who developed symptomatic cryptosporidiosis received oral sulphonamides than those who did not (91%, 10/11 v 48%, 21/44, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--The clinical and epidemiological findings indicate that infection was the consequence of very small inocula.

The capacity for greater fat absorption relative to carbohydrate absorption in protracted diarrhea of infancy was studied in a developed and a developing country (Buffalo, NY, and Bangkok, Thailand). Fifty patients with protracted diarrhea in the first year of life (defined as liquid stools of more than 20 mL/kg per day with more than a 14-day duration) were randomly assigned to receive either a standard semielemental diet (Pregestimil) or a high-fat semielemental diet that contained 40% more fat. The increased fat was largely in the form of medium-chain triglycerides, with the new diet providing 60% of the fat as medium-chain triglycerides compared with 40% in the standard diet. Tolerance to both diets was good in both studies. Both groups showed adequate weight gain and an improvement in anthropometric and biochemical parameters. The patients receiving the high-fat diet showed no initial weight loss, however, and their weight gain was initiated earlier. Cumulative weight gain was also higher in the group receiving the high-fat semielemental diet. Fecal fat analyses were performed after 1 week of therapy. There was no difference observed in the coefficient of fat absorption between the groups receiving the two formulas, indicating that infants with protracted diarrhea may be able to tolerate a higher fat intake than is normally provided. As carbohydrate intolerance is known to be a complicating factor when using semielemental enteral feeds for infants with protracted diarrhea, a higher-fat semielemental diet may be the most appropriate way to provide adequate caloric intake.

Overall mortality was 62%. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25%). Patients at increased risk were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, had initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and/or initial hemoglobin level less than eight on arrival at the ED and delay in beginning surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope, and the amount of blood transfused were largely reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality.

Patients also completed a standard battery of psychological tests. Psychophysiological responses were generally unrelated to age and education. Comparison of patients scoring high (more than 75%) and low (less than 25%) relative to the normal population on psychological measures indicated that heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental stress tests were significantly greater in those reporting low than in those reporting high neuroticism. The study population was subsequently divided into high, medium, and low cardiovascular responders on the basis of rate-pressure product reactions to the two stress tests. The three cardiovascular response groups did not differ in age, interval between myocardial infarction and stress testing, ejection fraction, incidence of exercise-induced ischemia, or ischemic signs during Holter monitoring. However, the high cardiovascular responders were more likely to manifest possible or definite electrocardiographic signs of ischemia or significant arrhythmia during mental stress testing than were the medium or low cardiovascular responders (50% versus 19.6% and 7%, respectively).

Evidence indicates that these risk factors in the elderly are similar to those in the young; namely, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, hyperfibrinogenemia, obesity, and cigarette smoking. The latter two relate to general patient management, whereas the remainder can be significantly influenced by modern drug therapy such as celiprolol.

Although dyspnea is often considered a single sensation, alternatively it may encompass multiple sensations that are not well explained by a single physiologic mechanism. To investigate whether breathlessness experienced by patients represents more than one sensation, we studied 53 patients with one of the following seven conditions: pulmonary vascular disease, neuromuscular and chest wall disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients were asked to choose descriptions of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a dyspnea questionnaire listing 19 descriptors. Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings among the chosen descriptors. We found that patients could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness. In addition, we found an association between certain groups of descriptors and specific conditions producing dyspnea. These findings concur with those in an earlier study in normal volunteers in whom dyspnea was induced by various stimuli. We conclude that different types of dyspnea exist in patients with a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Furthermore, different mechanisms may mediate these various sensations. ',\n",

Previous studies support the presence of an upper airway reflex mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of upper airway patency during sleep. We investigated the possibility that interference with this reflex mechanism contributes to the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Eight otherwise asymptomatic snorers (seven male and one female), age 39 +/- 5.3 yr (mean +/- SEM), underwent overnight sleep studies on three successive nights. An acclimatization night was followed by two study nights randomly assigned to control (C) and oropharyngeal anesthesia (OPA). On the OPA night topical anesthesia was induced using 10% lidocaine spray and 0.25% bupivacaine gargle. A saline placebo was used on night C. All subjects slept well on both study nights (mean sleep duration was 6.2 h on both study nights), and sleep stage distribution was similar on both nights. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas (OAH) rose from 114 +/- 43 during C to 170 +/- 49 during OPA (p less than 0.02). Central apneas and hypopneas (CAH) were unchanged between the two nights (8 +/- 4.9 versus 7 +/- 3). The duration of OAH was similar on both study nights (20 +/- 1.9 s during C versus 20 +/- 1.5 s during OPA). The frequency of movement arousals terminating OAH tended to be higher during OPA (7 +/- 2.9/h) than during C (3 +/- 0.7); P = NS. The frequency of oxyhemoglobin desaturations was also higher during OPA (5 +/- 2.1/h) than during C (3 +/- 1.4), p less than 0.07. ',\n",
       " '1': 'Neutrophil function and pyogenic infections in bone marrow transplant recipients. In a consecutive entry trial, the incidence and time course of decreased neutrophil function was assessed in 20 patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The aim of the study was to assess the prognostic value of low neutrophil function for late pyogenic infections. Chemotaxis, superoxide production, and phagocytic-bactericidal activity were studied before and 2, 6, 9, and 12 months after BMT. Skin window migration was quantitatively assessed 2 months after BMT. Infectious complications were recorded prospectively with preset criteria during 1 year. Six of the 20 leukemic patients had defective neutrophil function before BMT. Two months after BMT all 10 patients with greater than stage II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and 6 of 10 patients with less than or equal to stage II GVHD had at least one decreased function. At this time, patients with subsequent pyogenic infections had lower chemotaxis (P less than .05), phagocytic-bactericidal activity (P less than .005), and superoxide production (P less than .025) than those without. Defective skin window migration and combined defects were predictive for late pyogenic infections. At 9 months all tests were normal in seven patients surviving without GVHD. In contrast, at 9 months three of three patients, and at 1 year two of three with chronic GVHD had still decreased neutrophil function. In conclusion, neutrophil function is frequently impaired during the first months after BMT. Combined neutrophil defects predispose to pyogenic infections and indicate the patient at risk. ',\n",

Teniposide (VM-26) can increase intracellular methotrexate (MTX) and its polyglutamate derivatives in vitro and thus has the potential to improve the therapeutic index of regimens containing MTX. In this phase II study, children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second marrow relapse were randomly assigned to receive either simultaneous (n = 11) or sequential (n = 12) continuous infusions of MTX and VM-26 prior to reinduction. Infusions of VM-26 were begun 12 hours after completion of MTX infusion in the sequential group. Dosages were individually adjusted to maintain plasma concentration levels of 10 microns for MTX and 15 microns for VM-26; total infusion times were 24 and 72 hours, respectively. Significant toxicity in the first six patients who received the scheduled 72-hour VM-26 infusion (including one drug-related death) prompted a 50% reduction in infusion duration. The reduced dose was associated with similar but more manageable toxicity. Examination of bone marrow aspirates 10 days after therapy was begun showed one complete and two partial marrow remissions; a fourth patient who had an aplastic marrow on day 10 received no further chemotherapy and had a complete remission (CR) documented on day 31. There was no obvious clinical advantage associated with either infusion schedule, although small sample sizes preclude definitive conclusions. The 17% response rate to the MTX/VM-26 therapeutic window in patients with refractory disease suggests the need for further investigation to evaluate alternative schedules and concomitant therapy for this drug combination.

       " '3': 'Flow cytometric DNA analysis of parathyroid tumors. Implication of aneuploidy for pathologic and biologic classification. The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis. This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms. ',\n",

A heterogeneous group of five patients with progressive, invasive angiomatous diseases including pulmonary hemangiomatosis, angiosarcoma, or massive hemangioma with associated consumptive coagulopathy were treated with interferon alfa-2a for periods of 17 to 33 months. One patient with a large thoracic hemangioma, cardiorespiratory failure, and consumptive coagulopathy died after less than 2 months of treatment. The remaining four patients have shown beneficial responses, including (1) regression of abnormal vessels on pulmonary angiogram and improved exercise tolerance in pulmonary hemangiomatosis (two patients), (2) decreased corticosteroid and/or platelet transfusion requirements in consumptive coagulopathy (two patients), and (3) decreased size and number of tumor nodules in the one patient with angiosarcoma arising in preexisting angiomatous lesions. Responses occurred during periods of 2 to 20 months of treatment. There was no measurable progression of angiomatous lesions in any patient receiving interferon at the therapeutic dose, except possibly in the one who died. Each of the four surviving patients had improved linear growth and weight gain during interferon treatment. ',\n",

The immunoreactivity for class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in Warthin's tumor (WT) cells was studied. In addition to macrophages, dendritic cells, and capillary endothelia, the luminal tumor cells and some keratinocytes in the metaplastic squamous foci exhibited immunoreactivity for both class II antigens and IL-1. The distribution of the class II antigens in the luminal tumor cells was limited to their basolateral membrane. These data, together with previous findings, strongly suggest that the luminal tumor cells of WT introduce the luminal antigen to the underlying lymphoid tissue and, thus, act as an antigen-presenting cell. \",\n",

A series of 15 consecutive children with head and neck nonorbital rhabdomyosarcoma (RMSA) with meningeal extension were prospectively treated with chemotherapy consisting of Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratory, Columbus, OH) (ADM), vincristine (VCR), cyclophosphamide (CPM), and dactinomycin (DACT) followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) to the primary tumor volume, along with intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX). Thirteen of 15 responded to preradiation chemotherapy. Four of 13 relapsed. Relapse occurred at the level of the primary tumor in three of four. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 59%, similar to that achieved in a previous series treated with a comparable therapeutic approach that also included whole-brain radiotherapy as a prophylaxis of possible occult meningeal seeding. It is concluded that CNS prophylaxis with radiotherapy is questionable in the management of childhood RMSA with meningeal extension. ',\n",
       " '8': \"Reversibility of hepatic fibrosis in experimentally induced cholestasis in rat. The reversibility of hepatic fibrosis was investigated in an experimental model of extrahepatic cholestasis in the rat after common bile duct ligation for 2 weeks, followed by bilioduodenal anastomosis for 3 weeks. Bile duct ligation resulted in a transitory marked elevation in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin during the first 3 days. Then these levels decreased to threefold, twofold, and 100-fold the normal values, respectively, during the following 4 weeks. Histologic examination of the liver disclosed extensive bile duct proliferation and the formation of periportal fibrosis, with only slight inflammation and necrosis. The distribution of the major components of the hepatic extracellular matrix was analyzed 2 weeks after bile duct ligation, using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. Fibrous septa were found to be strongly stained for collagens I, pro-III, III and IV, fibronectin, and laminin. The most intense staining was found in enlarged periportal areas, collagen IV and laminin being particularly abundant around newly formed bile ducts. These changes paralleled high steady-state levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) collagen and B2 chain laminin mRNAs. Relief of the obstruction for 2 weeks resulted in a shift in the serum concentration of 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin toward normal values. A dramatic resorption of bile duct proliferations and periportal fibrosis were observed. Three weeks after bile duct repermeabilization, immunohistochemical study showed that the pattern of distribution of extracellular matrix components was almost normal, except for collagen IV, which remained abundant in the sinusoids when compared with the normal liver. In parallel, the steady-state B2-chain laminin mRNA level became lower than in cholestatic livers, whereas alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(IV) mRNAs were almost undetectable. These results show that hepatic fibrosis induced by experimental extrahepatic cholestasis in rat disappears in less than 3 weeks after relief of bile duct obstruction, suggesting that an active degradation of matrix protein occurs, except for collagen IV in the sinusoid. \",\n",
       " '9': 'Current status of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the examination of the abdominal vasculature. Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis. The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear. This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system. The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns. Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information. In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography.

Pseudomonas otitis externa is one of the most common infections treated by otolaryngologists. Infections induced in 30 guinea pigs appeared similar to that seen in humans. The ears were then placed into four treatment groups: group A, which received a single cleaning; group B, which received a single cleaning followed by gentamicin drops 4 times daily; group C, which received a single cleaning followed by a single gentamicin iontophoresis treatment; and group D, the control group, which received no treatment. Infections were analyzed by grading edema, purulence, and erythema. An average of 10.2 days was required for control group to return to normal appearance. Groups A, B, and C had mean resolution times of 5.9, 4.7, and 4.3 days, respectively. Gentamicin iontophoresis appears to be promising, with results as good as drop therapy in otitis externa in the guinea pig model. ',\n",

       " '14': 'Evidence for intraluminal Ca++ regulatory site defect in sarcoplasmic reticulum from malignant hyperthermia pig muscle. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease of humans and various animal species that predisposes to a life-threatening, anesthetic agent-induced syndrome. MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from MH muscle have been shown to have a Ca++ release channel defect. In the present study we have tested a hypothesis that the abnormal Ca++ release mechanism in MH can be expressed when Ca++ is loaded in the presence of pyrophosphate. SR membrane vesicles isolated from normal and MH pig muscle were loaded with Ca++ in the presence and absence of pyrophosphate until Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release occurred. Under both circumstances the threshold amount of Ca++ loaded until Ca++ release occurred was lower in the SR from MH pig skeletal muscle. This difference in amount of Ca++ preload is not explained by results obtained comparing rates of Ca++ uptake, number of ryanodine binding sites or the amounts of calsequestrin among SR vesicles from MH and normal muscle. We conclude from this study that use of pyrophosphate for Ca++ loading does not ablate the abnormal Ca++ release in SR from MH muscle, suggesting the study can be done on small amounts of SR from biopsied human muscle. The data also suggest that abnormality in an intraluminal, low affinity Ca++ binding site regulating Ca++ release occurs in the SR membrane of MH pig muscle. ',\n",

We review recent cross-disciplinary experimental and theoretical investigations on metabolism of the amino acid neurotransmitters glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain during hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in central control of breathing. The roles of classical modifiers of central chemical drive to breathing (H+ and cholinergic mechanisms) are summarized. A brief perspective on the current widespread interest in GABA and glutamate in central control is given. The basic biochemistry of these amino acids and their roles in ammonia and bicarbonate metabolism are discussed. This review further addresses recent work on central respiratory effects of inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate. Current understanding of the sites and mechanisms of action of these amino acids on or near the ventral surface of the medulla is reviewed. We focus particularly on tracer kinetic investigations of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms in hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in the ventilatory response to hypoxia. We conclude with some speculative remarks on the critical importance of these investigations and suggest specific directions of research in central mechanisms of respiratory control. ',\n",

Improvement of back extensor strength (BES) can be used as a therapeutic method for patients with chronic back pain and osteoporosis. The method of evaluation must be reliable and accurate without compromising the condition of the patient. We report the development of a back isometric dynamometer (BID-2000) designed specifically by two of us to address these concerns in elderly patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. As the demographics of the general population change, increasing numbers of patients will need the type of monitoring that the BID-2000 provides. Aging has been shown to cause a reduction in the number of functional muscle motor units. To examine this effect on BES, we tested 50 normal, healthy women who were 30 to 79 years old. Proper testing of BES in patients with fragile vertebrae should include isometric measurement in the prone position, maneuverability of the device to allow comfortable positioning of the patient, and simplicity of technique to minimize repetitious performance of maximal contraction. The BID-2000 incorporates each of these features and also provides meaningful results inexpensively. The device offers a safe, reliable (coefficient of variation = 2.33%), and valid (P = 0.001) method of evaluation. The results of our study demonstrated moderate, steady reduction of BES with increasing age and with each successive decade. ',\n",

The lips of 196 patients with a history of sun-induced herpes labialis were exposed to experimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and treated with acyclovir (ACV) or placebo at different times and by different routes. Of 98 placebo recipients, 39 (40%) developed 43 lesions inside or within 10 mm of the irradiated zone. The temporal distribution of lesions was bimodal. 11 (26%) occurring within 48 h (immediate) and 32 (72%) 2-7 days after UVR exposure (delayed). Prophylactic peroral ACV begun 7 days before or 5 min after UVR prevented the development of the delayed but not the immediate lesions (P less than .001). When peroral ACV was started 48 h after UVR, delayed lesions developed but were less severe (P = .01-.05). Prophylactic topical ACV begun 5 min after UVR did not reduce lesion frequency or severity. ACV therapy can be efficacious, but some rapidly developing lesions are unresponsive to treatment. This suggests that more than one process may contribute to the pathogenesis of herpes labialis.

A newly identified myopathy of the internal anal sphincter is described. In the affected family, at least one member from each of five generations had severe proctalgia fugax; onset was usually in the third to fifth decades of life. Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized. ',\n",

The hepatitis B virus genome encodes a transcriptional transactivator protein designated HBxAg. We have investigated whether this antigen is a target structure for human T-lymphocytes. Using recombinant HBxAg protein, we found HBxAg-specific stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 6) and chronic hepatitis B virus infection (6 of 17) but not in healthy individuals. With HBxAg-specific synthetic polypeptides, several T-cell epitopes were identified. Most were located in the carboxyterminal half of the HBxAg protein. Five T-cell clones specific for a T-cell epitope located at the carboxyterminal region of HBxAg were established and found to belong to the CD2/CD4-positive, CD8-negative subtype. These data establish for the first time HBxAg as an antigen in the cellular immune response. ',\n",

The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a group of cell surface glycoproteins involved in direct cell--cell adhesion. N-CAM expression in normal and neoplastic tissues was examined with specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Most neuroendocrine cells and tumors with secretory granules expressed N-CAM protein and mRNA. Parathyroid adenomas (4) were somewhat unusual, because N-CAM mRNA, but not protein, was detected in some of these benign neoplasms. Most non-neuroendocrine cells and tumors did not express N-CAM, although uterine smooth muscle and an adrenal cortical carcinoma were both positive. Western blots disclosed proteins of 180, 140, and 120 kd in normal adult brain, whereas two pheochromocytomas, a null cell adenoma, and a gastrinoma had proteins of approximately 180 and 140 kd. These results indicate that N-CAM protein and mRNA are widely expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms. N-CAM oligonucleotide probes as well as antibodies against N-CAM can be used as broad-spectrum neuroendocrine markers. In addition, these molecular probes can be used to examine the role of N-CAM in the development and regulation of neuroendocrine tissues. ',\n",

Direct investigation of intestinal humoral immunity requires collection of intestinal secretions or mucosal biopsy specimens, or both. A non-invasive technique of gut lavage, with a polyethyleneglycol electrolyte lavage solution as a means of collecting intestinal secretions for immunoglobulin and antibody studies, was evaluated. Fifty patients were studied--25 immunologically normal patients or volunteers, 15 patients with untreated coeliac disease, and 10 patients with active Crohn's disease. Protease inhibitors were added promptly to samples to prevent proteolysis of immunoglobulin content. Treated lavage samples were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin and antibody content. Studies of serial lavage specimens showed that early, faecally contaminated specimens contained negligible quantities of immunoglobulin, but once the specimens became clear a steady state was reached, with little variation in immunoglobulin content between serial specimens and with a uniform dilution (around 20%) of the ingested polyethyleneglycol. Gut lavage fluid IgA was predominantly secretory, comprising 92%, 81.6%, and 76.7% respectively of the total IgA gut lavage fluid content in the control, coeliac, and Crohn's groups. High values of total IgM and IgA and IgM antigliadin antibodies were detected in the coeliac group, and high values of IgG in the Crohn's disease group. This method of gut lavage is not only an effective bowel cleanser, but also a noninvasive means of obtaining intestinal secretions for the study of humoral immunity in gastrointestinal disease. \",\n",

The purpose of this study was to examine changes in subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer within different age groups. Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974. The present study was based on 15,395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983. Subsite distribution (right colon, left colon, rectum) for different age groups (25-49, 50-69, 70+ years) was significantly skewed, with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years. This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer. Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite. Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years. This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes. There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years. In contrast, the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals. Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts.

       " '24': 'Bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated thrombolytic infusions for myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytic therapy decreases mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and is now widely used in such patients. The choice of which thrombolytic agent to use in such patients, either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is based on regional preferences. The standard dose of streptokinase is 1.5 million units over 60 min, and the dose of rt-PA that is commonly used is 100 mg over 3 h. Experiments in animals have demonstrated that rt-PA produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is both increased and accelerated and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short time period. Based on these studies, there have been a number of recent trials examining alternative dosage regimens for rt-PA (bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated) in patients with myocardial infarction. To date, there is no convincing evidence that such regimens are superior to the more traditional rt-PA regimen. Future randomized trials will determine whether attempts to optimize rt-PA regimens will result in more efficacious treatment regimens. Interest in the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute pulmonary embolism has been rekindled. The traditional 12- to 24-h regimens of streptokinase and urokinase are not optimal because of their logistic complexity and associated hemorrhagic complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that rt-PA, 100 mg over 2 h, is an effective thrombolytic agent in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. In a recent double-blind trial in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, rt-PA, 0.6 mg/kg infused over 2 min, improved pulmonary perfusion. This bolus regimen is attractive because it is simple to administer. Future studies will compare the relative efficacy and safety of these two rt-PA regimens in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. ',\n",

The mutants of the second type constitute a set of nonoverlapping, adjacent deletions spanning amino acids 4 through 183 of the 184 amino acids in natural human IL-6. All of the mutants were expressed, along with the full length, cysteine-containing analogue, in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins, joined to beta-galactosidase through a collagen linker. This system allows microgram quantities of the rIL-6 variants to be partially purified from small bacterial cultures without chromatographic or refolding steps. Each of the rIL-6 variants was released from the beta-galactosidase fusion protein with collagenase, and the recovered rIL-6 was quantitated by laser densitometry of Coomassie-stained, SDS polyacrylamide gels. The sp. ac. of each of the rIL-6 variants was determined using four assays: induction of IgM secretion from an EBV transformed human B cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a human hepatoma cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a rat hepatoma cell line, and induction of proliferation of a murine hybridoma cell line. Replacement of cysteines with serines reduced activity relative to cysteine-containing rIL-6 to about 20% in the rat hepatoma assay and about 3% in the mouse hybridoma assay, whereas activity in both of the human cell lines was reduced to less than 0.1%. These data suggest that the murine and rat cell lines are less selective than the human cell lines in their requirements for recognition of biologically active IL-6. Each of the deletions, except that of amino acids 4 through 23, resulted in loss of activity in all four assays. These results suggest that the information necessary for activity is not contained within any one portion of the IL-6 molecule, but rather that multiple segments of the protein are required for each of the biologic activities that we tested.

Survival after prophylactic sclerotherapy was assessed in a single-center study involving 99 cirrhotic (41 alcoholic) patients enrolled over 8-yr. The wedged hepatic vein pressure gradient was measured; those with pressure greater than or equal to 12 mm Hg were randomized to receive sclerotherapy or no treatment. The rest were not randomized. Patients in all three groups who bled were treated with emergency endoscopy and sclerotherapy. Stratification according to presence of ascites was also undertaken. Median follow-up was 61 mo (range = 14 to 107 mo). Survival among unrandomized patients was significantly longer than among randomized patients (p less than 0.006), but there was no significant difference between those treated by sclerotherapy and the controls (p = 0.27). Alcoholic cirrhotic patients undergoing sclerotherapy had better 2-yr survival than did the controls (80% vs. 43%; p = 0.09), but this benefit was not sustained at 5 yr. Survival in the nonalcoholic patient groups was identical. Only 10 of 50 deaths were caused by variceal bleeding. Forty-eight percent of patients with large varices bled, compared with 20% of patients with small varices. Wedged hepatic vein pressure less than 12 mm Hg accurately identified alcoholic patients at low risk of variceal bleeding but not nonalcoholic patients. Only four episodes of variceal bleeding were attributable to elective sclerotherapy. We conclude that in our population, prophylactic sclerotherapy alone does not improve survival. The discrepancy in survival between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients suggests that factors other than variceal hemorrhage may be responsible for the difference. ',\n",

We sought to determine if failure to thrive in pediatric patients with the human immunodeficiency virus could be explained based on endocrine dysfunction. Fourteen human immunodeficiency virus-infected pediatric patients, all of whom had adequate nutritional status, underwent endocrine evaluation. Growth hormone and cortisol responses to glucagon stimulation were adequate. Despite this, eight of the 12 subjects had low somatomedin C levels. Although all patients were clinically and biochemically euthyroid, 36% (5/14) demonstrated elevated baseline and peak thyrotropin levels in response to thyroid releasing hormone, suggesting a state of compensated hypothyroidism. Although the importance of these findings is unclear, it is possible that subtle alterations of thyroid regulation may contribute to failure to thrive in some pediatric patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and may represent a potentially correctable defect.

OBJECTIVE--To determine the incidence of and risk factors for the development of secondary acute leukaemia and myelodysplasia in patients treated in British National Lymphoma Investigation's studies of Hodgkin's disease since 1970. PATIENTS--2676 Patients entered into Hodgkin's disease studies between February 1970 and November 1986. Data accrued up to November 1988 were analysed, ensuring a minimum follow up period of two years. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of multicentre trial data by case-control and life table methods. RESULTS--17 Cases of secondary leukaemia were recorded in this group of 2676 patients, giving an overall risk at 15 years of 1.7%. The risks of leukaemia after chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy with radiotherapy were not significantly different. The risk of leukaemia increased sharply with the amount of treatment given as measured by the number of attempts at treatment. The 15 year risks of leukaemia were 0.2%, 2.3%, and 8.1% for patients receiving one, two, or three or more attempts at treatment. The highest risk, 22.8% at 15 years, was observed in patients treated with lomustine (CCNU), and a case-control study suggested that this was an independent risk factor. The risk of secondary leukaemia was largely related to the overall quantity of treatment, although exposure to lomustine seemed to be an important risk factor. Treatment with both drugs and radiation was not more leukaemogenic than treatment with drugs alone. The greatest risk of secondary leukaemia was seen in multiply treated patients who were unlikely to be cured of Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS--Avoidance of secondary leukaemia should be a minor factor in the choice of treatment for Hodgkin's disease. \",\n",

       " '33': 'Tissue dose estimates following the selective uptake of 125IUdR and other radiolabelled thymidine precursors in resistant tumours. For the purposes of evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the radiohalogenated thymidine analogue 125IUdR, estimation of the radiation dose to the tumour cells and normal tissues is important. To determine the dose to any tissue from the radionuclide 125I is not simple, since the major emissions are very short-range Auger electrons. The cytotoxicity of 125I is strongly dependent on the position of the decay relative to the DNA, the principal target for cell sterilization. Estimates of the cytotoxicity of 125I based on the traditional MIRD recommended formulation (ICRU Report 32, 1979) may produce gross underestimates if it is incorporated into the DNA via the thymidine precursor 125IUdR. In this work, tissue count and autoradiography (ARG) data from studies by Bagshawe et al were used to estimate tissue doses following the administration of 125IUdR to LS174/T (a colorectal carcinoma) and CC3 (a choriocarcinoma) tumour-bearing animals, after a hydroxyurea block of the normal tissue turnover. The tumour cell toxicity is estimated from ARG data on the degree of 125I incorporation into the cell nucleus. Major drawbacks with 125I for this type of therapy are the long 60-day half-life, leading to radiological and waste disposal problems and the extreme short range of the radiotoxic effects. Possible alternative radiohalogens, 13I, 77Br, 131I and 211At, are suggested in place of 125I in the thymidine analog iododeoxyuridine. Dose calculations are performed and cytotoxicities estimated on the assumption that their biological retention characteristics are the same as for 125IUdR. ',\n",

DESIGN: Prospective, unblinded trial. SETTING: A university and community emergency department. PATIENTS: Sixty-three hemodynamically and neurologically stable children. INTERVENTION: Single dose of IM MPC. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial respirations, heart rate, arterial systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and Glasgow Coma Scale were measured at 30-minute intervals. Effectiveness was assessed by two independent observers using separate visual analog scales for cooperation and sedation. Times to sleep (27 +/- 24 minutes), sitting upright (103 +/- 87 minutes), ED discharge (4.7 +/- 2.4 hours), eating (11 +/- 7.9 hours), and normal behavior (19 +/- 15 hours) were acceptable. Minor, but statistically significant, changes in respiration rate (-1.9 +/- 0.4), heart rate (+4.5 +/- 1.8), oxygen saturation (-0.7 +/- 0.3%), and Glasgow Coma Scale (-2.5 +/- 0.6) occurred for 120 minutes after MPC. No serious complications or resuscitation were required. Mean visual analog scale scores were 5.0/10.4 or more in 71% of cases, with interobserver agreement very good (cooperation, r = .79; effectiveness, r = .80).

Twenty-six evaluable children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who failed to achieve initial remission after receiving two to seven drugs for at least a 4-week period were given teniposide (VM-26) and continuous infusion cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Twenty-two received 150 mg/m2 of VM-26 on days 1 and 2 with 100 mg/2 of Ara-C as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5; a second shortened course was given on day 14 to eight patients who had evidence of some antileukemic effect or were clinically judged able to tolerate a second course. The last four patients received three daily doses of VM-26 and a 7-day infusion of Ara-C at the same daily dosages. Twelve (48%) achieved complete remission (CR) of ALL. There was a trend toward decreasing response rates with an increasing number of drugs used in the initial induction regimen, i.e., five CR among seven patients with a prior two-drug induction attempt, six CR among 14 patients with a prior three- to four-drug induction attempt, and one CR among four patients with a prior five- to seven-drug induction attempt (P = 0.14). Ten of 17 non-T-cell patients and two of nine T-cell patients achieved remission (P = 0.10). The median time required to achieve a complete remission from the initiation of treatment was 26 days (range, 14-72 days). This period was shorter in those who required one course compared with those who required two induction courses, i.e., 25 days median vs. 44 days median. Toxicity was significant and due mainly to marrow aplasia and infection; one patient had severe prolonged VM-26-induced hypotension. Of the 12 patients entering remission, two were removed for marrow transplant and one was removed due to parental request. In the remaining nine patients, median remission duration was only 2 months (range, 1-18 months). All nine patients relapsed in the marrow. Among the entire group of 26 patients, only one patient is alive and a long-term event-free survivor (after allogeneic marrow transplant). Due to the current use of more aggressive initial induction regimens and the extremely poor prognosis in children who fail to achieve initial remission, more intensive regimens of continuation therapy or alternative therapies, such as bone marrow transplant, should be considered.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary calcium and sodium on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive rats (Wistar, WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl rats and on calmodulin (CaM) activator, a newly-discovered hydrophobic compound that increases CaM activity in SHR and spontaneously hypertensive mice (SHM) tissues (J Clin Invest 82:276, 1988). The CaM activator was assessed by its capacity to stimulate a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE). In Wistar rats, which were fed a high sodium diet (3.5%), BP significantly increased (P less than .01) from 106 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 8 mm Hg in parallel to an elevation of the CaM activator from 1.57 +/- 0.14 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 U. WKY, SHR, and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats were given low (0.15%) or high (2.5%) Ca diets, both with 1% sodium. In rats receiving high dietary Ca the progression of hypertension diminished and BP was lower in SHR (156 +/- 4 mm Hg) and young DS/JR rats (125 +/- 3 mm Hg) than in those receiving low dietary Ca (192 +/- 10 and 183 +/- 2 mm Hg). There was a concomitant decrease of CaM activator in these animals to levels indistinguishable from those of WKY or DR/JR rats. The activator was also found in the heart, kidneys and erythrocytes from SHM.

Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3). Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment. In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr). In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins. With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%. Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop. In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs. We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration. ',\n",

Responders were distinguished from nonresponders on the basis of changes in tumor size. PME/ATP decreased during therapy in three lymphomas that responded to therapy. In an adenocarcinoma and Ewing sarcoma that did not respond to therapy, PME/ATP increased. PME/ATP remained constant in two squamous cell carcinomas that responded to therapy and decreased in one squamous cell carcinoma that decreased in size by 40% but was classified as a nonresponder. Changes in PME/ATP did not always parallel changes in tumor size during therapy. In two patients, a decrease in PME/ATP preceded a decrease in tumor size.

We tested 11 patients with multiple sclerosis for the presence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)- or type II (HTLV-II)-related sequences. DNA from blood mononuclear cells was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction utilizing three different oligonucleotide primer pairs. Two of these primer pairs detect sequences shared between HTLV-I and HTLV-II in either p24, gag protein, or in p21, env transmembrane protein. The third primer pair was synthesized based on regions in the pol gene where amino acid sequences are conserved between HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the related bovine leukemia virus. The multiple sclerosis samples were consistently negative while appropriate control samples were positive. We conclude that viruses related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or bovine leukemia virus are not present in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and, therefore, that HTLV-bovine leukemia virus-related viruses are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial. \",\n",

Four hundred fifty-seven lesions were measured before and after a 26-month interval by computer-based quantitative angiography. The primary outcome variable was within-patient mean change in percent area stenosis. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 7.32 +/- 1.5 to 4.45 +/- 1.6 mmol/L. The mean change in percent area stenosis among controls was +0.80, indicating progression, while the mean change for the treatment group was -1.53, indicating regression (P = .039 by two-tailed t test for the difference between groups). Regression among women, analyzed separately, was also significant. The change in percent area stenosis was correlated with low-density lipoprotein levels on trial. We conclude that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels can induce regression of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Cancelling an operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is not always feasible or practical. Yet we know very little about the additional risk posed by a URI occurring in a child undergoing anesthesia and surgery. Using a large prospectively collected pediatric anesthesia database, we studied 1283 children with a preoperative URI and 20,876 children without a URI. We found that children with a URI were two to seven times more likely to experience respiratory-related adverse events during the intraoperative, recovery room, and postoperative phases of their operative experience. Although these children also experienced significant disruptions in temperature regulation, they were not at risk for any other deleterious events. The elevation in risk after URI as compared with children without a URI was not explained by differences in age, physical status scores, surgical site, and emergency or elective status. However, if a child had a URI and had endotracheal anesthesia, the risk of a respiratory complication increased 11-fold (95% confidence intervals 6.8, 18.1). We conclude that the administration of general anesthesia to children with a URI is not benign and that these children require more observation/management in all perioperative phases of their surgical procedure.

M-Mode echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimension and fractional shortening did not change with administration of vasodilators. Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity at end diastole decreased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 m/sec (p less than 0.01), and Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole decreased from 16 +/- 11 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole was compared with catheterization-determined pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure before and after administration of vasodilators in three patients, and there was a good agreement between these measurements. Thus noninvasive and sensitive assessment of the effect of vasodilators on pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure in patients with congestive heart failure is possible with continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities.

Clustered (CD23, 25, 39, 40, 27, 1c, w75) and unclustered (NuB1, 7F7, KiB3) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were tested. Almost all cases showed high reactivity to CD23, 27, w75, 39, 40, and NuB1: expression of CD1c was very low and that of 7F7, KiB3, and CD25 was variable. The reactivity of 7F7 and KiB3 was strictly correlated, and they correlated individually with CD25. Results show that the most frequent B-CLL phenotype (CD19+, 5+, 23+, 27+, 39+, NuB1+, KiB3 +/-, 7F7 +/-, and CD25 +/-) corresponds to one or more cellular subsets in the mantle zone. No correlation was found between MoAb expression, surface immunoglobulin (SIg) class or type, clinical stage, disease activity, or age at diagnosis. The only difference (statistically borderline) was the expression of 7F7 and KiB3 (in young versus old patients). This suggests that modulations in the expression of surface antigens do not affect the clinical behavior of the disease. ',\n",

The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents.

We describe the successful treatment and follow-up of a patient with refractory ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock with percoronary chemical ablation. After endocardial mapping was used to identify the \"tachycardia-related\" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents \"backwash\" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death. The only complication of this procedure was temporary third-degree AV block, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. ',\n",

Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension. While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS. Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events. Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant. Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety. Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature. Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage.

All 240 consecutive cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that underwent autopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between September 1962 and August 1986 were reviewed. Among these cases, 162, for which photographs of cut surfaces of the primary tumors were available, were grossly classified using a combination of both Eggel's classification and our own into three major types, i.e., nodular, massive, and diffuse as described by Eggel (Eggel H, Beitr Pathol Anat 1901; 30:506-604), and three subgroups of nodular type, i.e., single nodular type (type 1), single nodular type with extranodular growth (type 2), and contiguous multinodular type (type 3) by our classification (Kanai T et al., Cancer 1987; 60:810-819). Seventy-eight cases were classified as nodular type, comprising seven cases of type 1, 61 cases of type 2, and ten cases of type 3. Sixty-seven and 17 cases were classified as massive and diffuse type, respectively. Of the 78 nodular-type tumors, 59 measured less than 10 cm, whereas 64 of 67 massive-type tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The incidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor spread of HCC was significantly higher for tumors measuring more than 5 cm. As to the relationship between macroscopic type and tumor spread, the frequency of spread was lowest for type 1 tumors, and high for the other types. Intrahepatic metastasis was detected in 28.6% of type 1, 93.4% of type 2, 100% of type 3, and 98.5% of massive-type tumors. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 24.6% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 38.8% of massive-type and 52.9% of diffuse-type tumors. Hematogenous extrahepatic metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 47.5% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 74.6% of massive-type and 82.4% of diffuse-type tumors.

To find out whether the practice produced neurotoxic effects a morbidity prevalence study was conducted between 1988 and 1989. There were no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed miners in reported diagnoses of neurological disorder; however, exposed miners performed less well than did unexposed workers on cognitive state examinations; also, the proportion of men with scores in the impaired range was greater in the exposed than non-exposed group.

OBJECTIVE: To date, there have been no formal investigations of neuropsychological performance in patients with Tourette's disorder who are taking psychotropic medications. The authors conducted this study to provide such information. METHOD: They examined the neuropsychological performance of 96 patients 6-18 years old who met DSM-III-R criteria for Tourette's disorder; 51 of these patients were taking neuroleptic medications and 45 were not. The groups were well matched with regard to age, sex, education, and duration of symptoms. Each group was given a complete neuropsychological test battery as well as instruments rating symptoms of Tourette's disorder, obsessive-compulsive characteristics, and other behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: The patients taking medications did not differ from those not taking medications on any of the neuropsychological, intellectual, or educational measures. In addition, the groups did not differ with regard to level of Tourette's disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that patients with Tourette's disorder who do not experience intolerable side effects from neuroleptic medications are able to perform on educational, intellectual, and neuropsychological tests at a level comparable to that of unmedicated patients. These results have positive implications for patients with Tourette's disorder who respond to neuroleptic medications. \",\n",

The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML. With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment. Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL. The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34. Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22.

The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats, although a high salt diet failed to significantly elevate pressure in either group when compared with their appropriate (low salt diet) controls. The sensitivity of the isolated, perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM). A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine. The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response. No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine. These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term, high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure. Differences in the effectiveness of cocaine among the groups suggest that differences may exist in neuronal uptake (uptake 1). ',\n",

Infarcted myocardium shows an increase in integrated backscatter and loss of cardiac cycle-dependent variation in backscatter. The cyclic variation of backscatter is closely related to regional myocardial contractile function; the latter is a marker of myocardial ischemia. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intramural cyclic variation of backscatter can map and estimate infarct size. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmural myocardial infarction was produced in 12 anesthetized, open-chest dogs by total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 hours. A real-time ultrasonic tissue characterization instrument, which graphically displays integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5, cardiac cycle-dependent variation, and patterns of cyclic variation in backscatter, was used to map infarct size and area at risk of infarction. Staining with 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and Patent Blue Dye was used to estimate infarct size and the area at risk, respectively. The ratio of infarct size to area at risk of infarction determined with UTC correlated well with that determined with TCC (r = 0.862, y = 23.7 +/- 0.792x). Correlation coefficients for infarct size and area at risk were also good (r = 0.736, y = 12.3 +/- 737x for infarct size and r = 0.714, y = 5.80 +/- 1.012x for area at risk). However, UTC underestimated both infarct size and area at risk. CONCLUSIONS. Ultrasonic tissue characterization may provide a reliable, noninvasive method to estimate myocardial infarct size. ',\n",

The CYBEX II isokinetic dynamometer was used in the measurements. On an average of 8 yr after the injury, the mean strength deficit of the injured knees was minimal: 4 +/- 5% (range 0-28%) in extension and 2 +/- 4% (0-20%) in flexion. The average strength score (max. 100 points) was 90 +/- 11 (56-100), representing an excellent classification. In hamstrings, the relative strength deficit increased significantly with a higher speed of isokinetic movement (P less than 0.05). Compared with the strength parameters (peak torques), the other functional parameters of the injured knees (total work, average power, and peak torque acceleration energy) showed some but not significantly greater deficits (hamstrings 9-11%, quadriceps 6-8%). In conclusion, the general thigh muscle function in knees with old second-degree sprain of the medial ligament compartment appears good and acceptable, but the strength deficits are systematically greater in higher speeds of isokinetic movement.

Therefore, we studied the effect of these mediators on the cholinergic responsiveness of isolated human airway segments. Lung tissue collected at thoracotomy from 30 patients was studied. Dose-response curves to MCh were obtained from bronchial segments before, during, and after incubation with either a subthreshold or a threshold concentration of histamine (10(-10) or 10(-8) M), the stable TxA2 analogue U46619 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M), PGD2 (5 x 10(-9) or 5 x 10(-7) M), PGF2 alpha (10(-9) or 10(-7) M), or LTC4 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M). With the exception of LTC4, the presence of any of these mediators at either concentration increased the sensitivity to MCh by a factor of 1.1 to 2 (p less than 0.05, ANOVA). This increase did not depend on the dose of the mediator (p greater than 0.05, ANOVA).

Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be influenced by many factors. Therefore, 137 patients in whom paired radionuclide angiograms were obtained within 24 h of acute infarction and before hospital discharge were retrospectively evaluated to determine which factors most affect improvement in ejection fraction. Only baseline ejection fraction correlated significantly with improvement in ejection fraction by both univariate analysis (ejection fraction as a continuous variable; p less than 0.001; ejection fraction as a categorical variable, less than or equal to 45% versus greater than 45%, p less than 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p less than 0.0001). Reperfusion status (patent versus occluded infarct artery) and extent of coronary artery disease (one, two or three vessel) were significant factors by multivariate but not by univariate analysis. Location of infarction, treatment modality and time to treatment did not correlate with change in ejection fraction by either statistical technique. Thus, of those factors tested, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is the most potent predictor of improvement in ventricular function after acute infarction. Knowledge of baseline ejection fraction may be helpful in deciding whether to treat some patients with equivocal indications or contraindications for reperfusion therapy. Clinical trials of reperfusion strategies should stratify patients on the basis of baseline ejection fraction if ejection fraction is to be used as an end point for myocardial salvage. ',\n",

Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin. Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin. Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message. In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure. Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate. It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis. These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions. ',\n",

The operative techniques were largely standardized. Patients were studied by means of a limited barium enema on the ninth or tenth postoperative day. The data have been analyzed for leakage rate (clinical and roentgenologic), other complications and degree of experience of the surgeon. Eleven patients were excluded from the analysis because the selected technique could not be carried out; of these, eight were in the stapled group in which it was possible to perform a sutured anastomosis. There were no instances in which it was possible to staple but not possible to suture. The remaining three exclusions were patients in whom either a coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure was performed. There was no over-all difference in the leakage rate--roentgenologic, clinical or total--between the two groups. However, when analyzed by the surgeon, the clinical leakage rate for surgeons in training was greater for sutured anastomoses than for stapled anastomoses (p = 0.053). Thus, it appears that the benefits of experience are more pronounced for sutured anastomoses but that, in experienced hands, neither technique is superior. ',\n",

To study alterations in host defense mechanisms that enhance pneumococcal virulence, a model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia was developed in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis, with or without ascites, was produced in rats by intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Histopathologic and laboratory studies demonstrated that CCl4-induced cirrhosis was similar to alcoholic cirrhosis in humans. Cirrhotic rats were more susceptible to type 3 pneumococcal pneumonia induced by intratracheal challenge than controls, and the presence of ascites was associated with the lowest LD50. More cirrhotic rats with ascites had bacteremia and elevated levels of circulating capsular antigen after challenge compared with cirrhotic rats without ascites or controls. Pulmonary clearance of pneumococci was markedly reduced in rats with cirrhosis and ascites and was associated with reduced serum complement levels. This model may be useful in further studies of the pathogenesis and therapy of pneumococcal infections in the compromised host. ',\n",

To determine whether latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) occurs after infection, 27 infants with acute bronchiolitis were studied and compared with 15 hospital controls. Blood was collected for whole blood challenge, and histamine release was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography technique with fluorometric detection. There was a significantly greater histamine release to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) in those with bronchiolitis than in controls, expressed either in amount (median 154 nmol/l compared with 104 nmol/l) or percentage release (median 20% compared with 3%). There was a significant difference between index and control groups in terms of individual histamine responses. These findings strongly suggest that infants develop latent sensitivity to respiratory syncytial virus antigen(s) during the course of acute bronchiolitis. Serial lung function tests were performed in 15 infants. All infants had abnormalities of lung function at some stage, but the small numbers of subjects precluded comparison between 'sensitised' and 'non-sensitised' infants. Further study is indicated to define the relation of latent sensitisation and subsequent bronchial hyper-responsiveness after respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants. \",\n",
       " '84': 'A 47-kDa human nuclear protein recognized by antikinetochore autoimmune sera is homologous with the protein encoded by RCC1, a gene implicated in onset of chromosome condensation. Several autoimmune sera from patients with Raynaud phenomenon decorated mammalian kinetochores and bound to a 47-kDa protein on immunoblots of nuclear lysates. Antibody affinity-purified from immunoblots of the 47-kDa band recognized kinetochores, but due to crossreaction with an 18-kDa protein, localization remains elusive. We used one of these sera to purify the antigen from HeLa cells synchronized in mitosis as a noncovalent complex with a 25-kDa protein. The antigen was released from DNA by intercalation with 25 mM chloroquine. Ion-exchange chromatography yielded the pure complex with an apparent molecular size of 68 kDa, which was separated into its components by gel filtration in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the 47-kDa protein gave two main spots of pI 6.6 and 6.7, respectively. Posttranslational modification is indicated by additional antigenic spots, by lack of a free alpha-amino group, and by chromatographic behavior of peptides on reversed-phase chromatography. The amino acid sequence for 205 residues of the 47-kDa protein has been established. This sequence is highly homologous with the translated reading frame of RCC1, a gene reportedly involved in regulating onset of mammalian chromosome condensation. ',\n",

To determine whether the neuroprotective properties of phenobarbital would alter the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, we randomly assigned 110 women at less than 31 weeks of gestation to receive 10 mg/kg phenobarbital or placebo in a blinded fashion before delivery. Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups. We conclude that antenatal administration of phenobarbital appears to be effective in decreasing the severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants delivered at less than 31 weeks of gestation.

The APACHE II severity of disease classification system has been examined prospectively in 160 patients with acute pancreatitis. Using clinical and simple laboratory data APACHE II was able to provide useful discrimination between uncomplicated, complicated and fatal attacks within a few hours of admission. Peak APACHE II scores (recorded during the first 3 days) had a prognostic accuracy similar to the multiple factor scoring systems, but then incurred a similar delay. Patients could be graded according to their risk of death or of developing a major complication; no deaths occurred in patients with a peak APACHE II score less than 10. APACHE II can be repeated daily, uncomplicated attacks demonstrating falling scores in association with clinical improvement, in contrast to the rising scores associated with clinical deterioration in those dying early. APACHE II appears to reflect any continuing disease activity and may prove a useful means of monitoring the course of the illness and response to therapy. ',\n",
       " '87': 'Efficacy of nimodipine in cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage. Our studies showed that in an appropriate dose, nimodipine increased local cerebral blood flow with no corresponding increase in local metabolism. Nimodipine treatment given before experimental ischemic insult, resulting from either vascular occlusion or intracranial hemorrhage or after subarachnoid hemorrhage, maintained or improved blood flow and minimized the severity of subsequent brain damage. Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult. Our findings are compatible with the benefit of nimodipine being due to an improvement in blood flow that reduces the severity of ischemia. However, they do not exclude the possibility that treatment may minimize the accumulation of calcium in damaged cells as a result of \"cytoprotective\" effects. ',\n",

We have examined the pathophysiological role of readmission of oxygen (and hence production of oxygen-derived free radicals) in the initiation of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias by separating, on a temporal basis, readmission flow from readmission of oxygen. Isolated rat hearts (n = 12/group) were subjected to 10 minutes of regional ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion. In controls reperfused with oxygenated solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg), 92% of hearts developed ventricular fibrillation (VF) during the first 20 seconds of reperfusion, whereas in hearts reperfused with hypoxic solution (Po2 9.3-12.2 mm Hg), the incidence of VF was only 17% (p less than 0.05). Subsequent readmission of control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) to the latter group led, within 20 seconds, to the appearance of VF in seven of the 10 hearts (70%) that had not previously fibrillated. To examine whether hypoxic reperfusion had prevented VF or merely delayed its onset, the studies were repeated in separate groups of hearts with the duration of hypoxic reperfusion extended to 5 minutes. In addition, to examine the partial pressure dependence of the relation, the Po2 in the reperfusion solution was set at one of five different levels: greater than 600, 150-192.7, 69-85.6, 9.2-14.8, or 0.0 mm Hg. It was found that hypoxia merely delayed VF onset by 20-40 seconds and did not significantly reduce the incidence of VF, which was 83%, 92%, 67%, 58%, and 58%, respectively. This indicated that readmission of oxygen is unnecessary for the initiation of VF during reperfusion. The hearts that reverted to sinus rhythm during the ensuing 5 minutes (n = 8, 4, 5, 9, and 8, respectively) were used to assess the arrhythmogenic consequences of readmission of oxygen. When control solution (Po2 greater than 600 mm Hg) was readmitted, new episodes of VF were elicited within 20 seconds in a manner that was inversely proportional to the preceding Po2 (p less than 0.05), the incidence of new episodes of VF being 0%, 0%, 40%, 67%, and 86%, respectively. The arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was not the result of a sudden increase in heart rate, because a similar arrhythmogenic effect of readmission of oxygen was seen in separate groups of hearts that were paced (350 beats/min) throughout hypoxia and readmission of oxygen. In conclusion, readmission of flow and readmission of oxygen are independent determinants of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). ',\n",

Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.

Also evaluated was the effect of interleukin 2-interferon alfa therapy on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity as well as total lymphocyte count, percent of lymphocyte subsets, and levels of both circulating immune complexes and antibody classes. Both the percent and absolute number of natural killer cells (ie, CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes) within peripheral blood as well as natural killer cell activity against K562 targets increased significantly with treatment. The remaining immune parameters were not significantly altered.

The methodology addresses four important components of the analytic process: (1) the criteria that must be satisfied for a clinical practice to be considered effective; (2) proper methods for reviewing evidence from published clinical research to determine whether a clinical practice meets these criteria (including methods for performing comprehensive literature reviews, for judging the quality of individual studies, and for synthesizing or pooling the results of multiple studies); (3) theoretical and practical concerns in translating the results of the scientific review into sound clinical practice recommendations; and (4) the importance of documentation, guidelines, and other safeguards to minimize the effect the reviewers themselves have on the objectivity and consistency of the analytic methods.

Forty six patients aged 18-39 years with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) were studied; two thirds were women. Twenty five patients had attacks accompanied by headache, and seven gave a history of common migraine. Only four of 27 angiograms were abnormal; no operable carotid lesion was demonstrated. Over a mean follow up period of 10 years stroke or myocardial infarction (AMI) occurred in all four patients who presented major cerebrovascular risk factors, but in only two of the remaining 42 patients. Thus irrespective of age thromboembolic TIA is a harbinger of stroke or AMI. However, most TIAs under the age of 40 years are caused by a non-embolic benign vascular disorder. The clinical characteristics, long-term prognosis, and possible pathogenesis, for such attacks are often indistinguishable from those of classical migraine.

The systems included a Spacelabs Alpha 14 Model Series 3200 ECG Cardule at bandwidths of 0.05-125 Hz and 0.5-30 Hz (a typical operating room monitor), a Marquette Electronics MAC II ECG at 0.05-40 Hz and 0.05-100 Hz (a standard ECG), and a Del Mar Holter recorder at 0.1-100 Hz. Relative ST-segment position and incidence of new ischemia compared to the preoperative ECG were determined in 109 sets of preinduction traces and 877 sets of intraoperative traces. ST-segment position on the three recording systems conforming with the American Heart Association (AHA) low-frequency response recommendations (0.05 Hz) were similar. Compared to the standard ECG, ST-segment position on the Spacelabs at 0.5-30 Hz was consistently more negative. Displacement on the Holter was consistently less negative and less positive. By the 0.1-mV displacement criterion for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia on any one ECG system, 16.5% of patients on arrival and 32.1% of patients intraoperatively suffered new myocardial ischemia. Based on the operating room monitor, arrival and intraoperative ischemia were present in 15.6 and 27.5% of patients, respectively.

STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies examining caffeine as a cause of cardiac arrhythmias and a selection of basic science experiments to illustrate caffeine's effects in vitro. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all available clinical data pertaining to caffeine as a cause of arrhythmias were summarized. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: In one electrophysiologic study, caffeine was associated with an increased susceptibility to provoked cardiac arrhythmias. In five placebo-controlled trials, caffeine in doses up to 500 mg daily (equivalent to 5 to 6 cups of coffee) did not increase the frequency or severity of ventricular arrhythmias. One large epidemiologic study reported an increase in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles in persons consuming 9 or more cups of coffee daily.

Subinoculation experiments revealed that numerous virulent organisms were present in the placentas of unprotected gravida but were absent from the fetal livers of their conceptuses. It was also found that mice preimmunized with irradiated P. yoelii survived a usually lethal challenge infection during mid-gestation and delivered healthy newborns. Associated with this protection against transplacental spread of parasites was the additional key finding that placental macrophages were as effective as peritoneal exudate cells in phagocytosing parasite derived material in vitro.

Such worries affected the moods (26%) and daily functioning (17%) of these women, despite diagnostic evaluation excluding malignancy. For each variable, a consistent trend (P greater than 0.05) was seen with degree of mammogram abnormality. Sixty-eight percent of women with normal results, 78% of women with low-suspicion results, and 74% of women with high-suspicion results obtained their subsequent annual mammograms (P greater than 0.05). The number of previous mammograms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and the effect of the previous results on concerns about breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.5; CI, 0.2 to 1.0) were independent predictors of adherence in logistic regression analyses (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with suspicious mammograms have psychological difficulties, even after learning that they do not have cancer. Such sequelae do not appear to interfere with subsequent adherence. \",\n",
       " '112': 'Influence of age and endocrine factors on the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia. To determine whether endocrine factors influence the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 23 hormonal factors were measured in the serum of 64 men ages 42 to 71 years with low volume prostatic cancer and these levels were correlated with the volume of benign hyperplastic tissue in their radical prostatectomy specimens. With age there was a significant increase in the volume of BPH. Also with age there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandronsterone (DHA), dehydroepiandronsterone sulphate (DHA-S), delta 5-androstenediol, and 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and a significant increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, and FSH. When BPH volume and hormone levels were corrected for age, BPH volume correlated positively with free testosterone, estradiol, and estriol. These data indicate that with age patients with larger volumes of BPH have higher serum androgen and estrogen levels suggesting that serum androgen and estrogen levels may be factors in the persistent stimulation of BPH with age. If so, therapeutic attempts at lowering plasma testosterone levels, reducing estrogen levels, or blocking androgenic stimulation through other mechanisms may interfere with the progression of BPH with age. Conversely, the fact that androgen production declines gradually with age may explain the observation that only 20 to 30% of men who live to age 80 require surgical treatment for urinary obstruction from BPH.

DNA-synthesis rates and concentrations of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) progenitor cells were studied in 22 patients treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL3) as part of a clinical phase I/II study. Recombinant hIL3 at doses of 60 to 500 micrograms/m2 was administered by subcutaneous bolus injection for 15 days to 13 patients with solid tumors and preserved hematopoietic function and to nine patients with bone marrow failure, including five with myelodysplastic syndromes. Following treatment with rhIL3, the percentage of actively cycling BM erythroid (BFU-E) and multilineage (CFU-GEMM) progenitors in patients with preserved hematopoietic function increased from 16% to 36% (P less than .05) and from 10% to 40% (P less than .01), respectively. The DNA-synthesis rates of early and late granulocyte macrophage progenitor cells increased from 11% to 26% (CFU-GM day 14; P less than .02) and from 13% to 30% (CFU-GM day 7; P less than .05). There was an increase in BM cellularity from 37% to 58%, and of the myeloid to erythroid ratio from 1.4 to 3.2, while the concentration of marrow progenitors on a per cell basis was unchanged or slightly decreased. The frequencies of blast cells in the BM were unchanged. Mean levels of PB CFU-GM day 14 and CFU-GEMM were 100% and 72% above baseline values after 7 days of rhIL3 but only 25% and 28% above initial levels at the end of treatment. Peripheral blood BFU-E were reduced in the majority of patients with normal marrow after both 7 and 15 days of rhIL3. No augmentation of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GEMM was seen in 5 patients with MDS who had few or no PB BFU-E or CFU-GEMM initially. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts increased significantly (P less than .01) in 21 of 22 patients with a peak response after a median of 13 days of rhIL3. While a small increase in reticulocytes was not accompanied by an elevation of the hemoglobin or hematocrit, platelet counts increased by 50% in patients with preserved marrow function. Thus, rhIL3 induces a multilineage response in vivo, apparently by stimulating proliferation of multipotential and lineage-restricted progenitors. It remains to be determined whether this is due to direct or indirect effects on the progenitor cells. ',\n",

The conventional method of ascitic fluid culture detects bacteria in only 50% of cirrhotic patients with neutrocytic ascites and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We have prospectively compared two ascites culture methods in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: 1) conventional (on chocolate agar, blood agar, Mac Conkay agar, and thioglycolate broth), and 2) modified [inoculation of 10 ml of ascites in a tryptic soy broth (TSB) blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside]. In a 21-month period, 70 episodes of SBP were diagnosed according to our criteria in 60 cirrhotic patients. Both culture methods were performed simultaneously. The conventional grew bacteria in 40 episodes (57%), whereas the modified grew bacteria in 54 episodes (77%), a significantly higher sensitivity (p = 0.0001). In 16 cases (23%), ascitic culture was negative by both methods. The mortality rate was higher among patients with culture-positive SBP than those with culture-negative SBP (46% vs 37%), but did not reach statistical significance. We conclude that ascitic fluid inoculated into a TSB blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside should be used routinely for ascites culture in cirrhotic patients. \",\n",

A case of extrahepatic portal vein aneurysm associated with an unusually tortuous portal vein is described. Real-time ultrasonography showed anechoic masslike lesions at the porta hepatis communicating with the superior mesenteric vein and intrahepatic portal branches. This suggested the presence of two saccular portal vein aneurysms, 27 x 21 mm and 21 x 13 mm in size. Magnetic resonance imaging and portal venography confirmed the portal vein aneurysms and an unusually tortuous portal vein curving caudally between them. The liver was histologically normal and there was no evidence of portal hypertension. It is speculated that these portal vein aneurysms may have been congenital and that the associated tortuous portal vein might have been secondary to hemodynamic changes in the portal venous system.

Research on mapping diabetes-susceptibility genes is dependent on several factors, including the existence of a single major gene for susceptibility, genetic homogeneity, and the existence of appropriate clinical material. The power to detect susceptibility genes is dependent on the risks in relatives and the distance of genetic markers from the susceptibility genes. For insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), the best-fitting risk models are those with a single major locus with residual polygenic factors. The major locus effect is likely represented by genes in the HLA complex, because specific genotypes have been found to affect IDDM risk significantly. Thus, mapping the remaining polygenic IDDM susceptibility factors--each of small effect--is a difficult and long task. For non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the likely risk models result in few genes with moderate effect. Models of NIDDM have significant residual polygenic variation remaining, reflecting the importance of multiple loci with small effect, environmental effects, or genetic heterogeneity; however, the prospects for mapping genes that provide at least moderate susceptibility for NIDDM now appear promising.

An increasing number of chronic pain treatment outcome studies have appeared in the literature. In general, these studies support the efficacy of multidisciplinary pain programs, as well as specific treatment modalities such as biofeedback and relaxation. Reviews of this literature have tended to be cautiously optimistic. Some concerns, however, have been raised about the methodological adequacy of these studies, particularly in terms of the lack of control groups, the brief duration of follow-up periods, and the vague criteria used for establishing the success of the therapeutic interventions. Other factors that mitigate conclusions regarding the generalizability of the favorable results reported need to be considered. In this paper 3 rarely discussed topics that are implicit within most treatment outcome studies and that need to be given greater attention are examined. These topics include: (1) referral patterns to pain clinics (who are referred to pain clinics, when, and how representative is the referred sample?); (2) failure to enter treatment (e.g., exclusion criteria, lack of available financial support to cover the cost of treatment, patient's refusal to accept recommendations), and consequently, the representativeness of the treated sample; and (3) patient's attrition. In this paper we discuss each of these factors as they underscore important qualifications that have to be made in evaluating treatment outcome studies. \",\n",

Three patients (25%) died of tumor recurrence and three (25%) died of other causes. Unifocal and intrahepatic tumors were associated with better prognosis compared to the multifocal tumors and tumors with extrahepatic spread (p = 0.04 and 0.13). Microscopically vascular invasion and the predominance of embryonal and/or anaplastic epithelium were associated with a poor prognosis compared to the tumors with no vascular invasion and with predominantly fetal epithelium (p = 0.08 and 0.1).

To assess the relation between increases in contractile function and oxygen consumption (VO2) during increased coronary flow (Gregg's phenomenon), we measured the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the relation between VO2 and left ventricular systolic pressure-volume area (PVA, a measure of total mechanical energy output) in blood-perfused, isovolumically contracting rabbit hearts during control and intracoronary adenosine infusion. During adenosine infusion at a constant perfusion pressure (93 +/- 11 mm Hg), coronary flow increased by 99 +/- 76% (p less than 0.01), and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Emax (ventricular contractility index), increased by 18 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01). When compared at the same left ventricular volume, PVA increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) and VO2 by 19 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) with adenosine. The VO2-PVA relation was linear under each condition (both median r = 0.98). With increased coronary flow, the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation (unloaded VO2) increased by 22 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) without a change in the slope; that is, a parallel upward shift was observed, indicating that the contractile efficiency (energy conversion efficiency of the contractile machinery) remained constant. These increases in Emax and unloaded VO2 were not eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. We conclude that increased coronary flow with adenosine at a constant perfusion pressure augments both Emax and the nonmechanical energetic cost for excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism via nonadrenergic mechanisms, without changing contractile efficiency. \",\n",

TEE was indicated whenever the transthoracic approach was not diagnostic or was inconsistent with the clinical setting. The most frequent clinical indications were to investigate the source of emboli, assess valvular regurgitation, and identify valvular vegetations. In 72 patients (82%) TEE significantly influenced management decisions. In selected patients TEE avoided the use of more invasive diagnostic procedures. Adverse effects included occasional premature atrial or ventricular beats (11 patients), sinus bradycardia (six patients), and protracted nausea (one patient).

Eighteen men with symptomatic coronary artery disease, exercise-induced ischemia and minimal symptoms, underwent 4 blinded treatment periods of 2 weeks' duration (2 placebo, 1 atenolol, 1 nifedipine). Those that did not have ischemia eliminated by monotherapy received combination therapy with both drugs. Forty-eight-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was used to quantitate ischemic parameters at the end of each period. Both nifedipine and atenolol as monotherapy reduced the number of ischemic episodes and the average duration of each episode compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced the total duration of ischemia (p less than 0.05) but the effect of atenolol on ischemia duration was of borderline significance (p = 0.066). There were no differences in reduction of ischemic parameters when atenolol was compared with nifedipine (difference not significant). In the 9 patients who continued to have ischemia with monotherapy, combination therapy eliminated it in 2 and reduced the duration by greater than 50% in the remaining patients compared with placebo. In conclusion, monotherapy with nifedipine or atenolol is similarly effective in eliminating or reducing ambulant ischemia. Combination therapy can provide additional benefit in those with continued ischemia. \",\n",

The inhibitory activity of PQQ was more potent than that of idebenone, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid in all the three assay systems. In the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction, PQQ had no effect on the formation of uric acid at the concentration of CL inhibition. These results suggest that PQQ might have a radical scavenger-like activity. Structure-activity relationship of PQQ and its six related compounds showed that the 7- and 9-carboxyl groups of PQQ as well as the orthoquinone structure are responsible for the radical scavenger-like activity. In addition, the -NH group in the pyrrole ring of PQQ seemed to be essential for the antilipid peroxidative activity in the rat brain homogenate.

In the control subjects, peaks of flow in systole and diastole were observed, and mean SVC flow was 35% of the cardiac output. Respiratory gating was used in six control subjects to acquire images at end inspiration and end expiration, and although the systolic peak was reduced at end expiration, total flow was unchanged. A reduced systolic peak and retrograde flow in the IVC were observed in patients with tricuspid regurgitation. A reduced diastolic peak was seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, pericardial constriction, and right ventricular dysplasia, reflecting reduced diastolic compliance of the right ventricle. In the patient with obstruction of the SVC, absence of flow was confirmed, and retrograde flow was seen in the azygos vein.

In resections of the proximal femur, distal femur, or proximal tibia and reconstruction with nonexpansible prostheses, the results were excellent or good in 75%. On the other hand, when arthrodeses of the lower extremity were used, only 14% of cases had a good result. This correlates with the resulting lack of articulation and serious limb shortening seen with progression of skeletal growth. \",\n",
       " '144': 'Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: the Harborview experience. During the last decade (1980 to 1989) 186 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were admitted to a single urban hospital. Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care. Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home. Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death. No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours. From this experience we conclude that, although \"optimal\" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die. Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable. Screening of patients at high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm, followed by elective aneurysmorrhaphy, is clearly indicated. ',\n",

To test the prognostic value of plasma renin activity prospectively, we determined the pretreatment renin-sodium profile of 1717 subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age, 53 years; 36 percent white; 67 percent men) in a systematic work-site treatment program. METHODS. Renin profiles, obtained by plotting plasma renin activity against the urinary excretion of sodium, were classified as high (12 percent of the subjects), normal (56 percent), and low (32 percent), and there were expected variations according to age, sex, and race. Modified stepped-care treatment for hypertension, prescribed without reference to the renin profile, was similar in the three renin groups. RESULTS. Mean (+/- SD) blood pressure at entry was 151 +/- 19/100 +/- 10 mm Hg in the subjects with a high renin profile, 151 +/- 19/97 +/- 10 mm Hg in those with a normal profile, and 151 +/- 20/96 +/- 11 mm Hg in those with a low profile. During 8.3 years of follow-up, there were 27 myocardial infarctions. As adjusted for age, sex, and race, the incidence of myocardial infarction per 1000 person-years was 14.7 among the subjects with a high renin profile, 5.6 among those with a normal profile, and 2.8 among those with a low profile (rate ratio for high vs. low, 5.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 8.3). The rate of mortality from all causes was 9.3 in the high-profile group, 5.3 in the normal-profile group, and 3.9 in the low-profile group. The independent association of a high renin profile with myocardial infarction (but not with stroke or noncardiovascular events) was affirmed by Cox analyses (rate ratio for high vs. normal plus low, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.4) after adjustment for race, sex, age at entry, serum cholesterol level, smoking status, electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, blood glucose level, body-mass index, history of cardiovascular disease or treatment, blood pressure, and use of beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS. In the study population, whose blood pressure before and during treatment was in a narrow range, and after other cardiovascular risk factors had been considered, the renin profile before treatment remained independently associated with the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction.

The goals of treatment of the Budd-Chiari syndrome are relief of portal hypertension, relief of inferior vena cava syndrome, if present, and preservation of hepatic function. This study presents a patient with clinical resolution of the Budd-Chiari syndrome after placement of expandable metallic stents in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A 26-year-old man with severe ascites and lower extremity edema but with relatively preserved hepatic function had a small gradient across a suprahepatic caval web, large gradients across an intrahepatic caval stenosis and the left hepatic vein, and an occluded right hepatic vein. Under angiographic control, web and caval stenosis were balloon-dilated, and modified Gianturco expandable metallic stents were placed in the intrahepatic vena cava. The left hepatic vein was dilated twice and a stent was placed. All gradients were completely eliminated. There were no complications and after 1 year, the stents have fully expanded without migration, edema and ascites have resolved, hepatic function has normalized, and the patient has returned to work. This new technique provides a simple, safe, effective, relatively inexpensive, and potentially long-lasting treatment for selected patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome. ',\n",
       " '148': 'Renovascular beta adrenergic hypersensitivity and hyperinsulinemia in rats with dietary-induced obesity. To determine whether obesity alters responsiveness to vasoactive drugs, we compared the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin, phenylephrine and isoproterenol in unanesthetized age-matched control and obese Oscai rats. Obesity was induced by programming pups to overeat immediately after birth and then feeding them a high-fat diet thereafter. Elevations in tail-cuff systolic and mean pressures from 7 through 11 months of age and in plasma insulin at 8 months of age indicated that obese rats had developed borderline hypertension and hyperinsulinemia. Cardiovascular responsiveness was then tested by recording blood pressure, heart rate and renal blood flow from chronically implanted arterial catheters and flow probes while graded doses of the three test drugs were infused intravenously. Heart rate and renal blood flow decreased during pressor responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine and were oppositely increased during depressor responses to isoproterenol. Magnitude of all cardiovascular receptors was dose-dependent. Obese rats had weaker reflex bradycardic responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine than control rats. More importantly, they also had larger renal vasoconstrictor responses to 2 ng/100 g of angiotensin or vasodilator responses to 15 ng/100 of isoproterenol. Whether or not the changes in cardiovascular responsiveness were related to hyperinsulinemia was undetermined. Our results suggest that, in addition to being overweight, slightly hypertensive and hyperinsulinemic, obese Oscai rats have impaired baroreflexes and a renal vascular bed more responsive to beta adrenergic vasodilation.

Anorectal function was evaluated in 11 patients with voiding dysfunction due to multiple sclerosis. In six patients with constipation, three also had symptoms of obstructed defecation and one patient was incontinent due to stercoral diarrhea. One patient was only fecal incontinent and one patient had obstructed defecation as the only symptom. Three patients had no anorectal symptoms. Anal manometry in the women compared with a control group revealed significant lower anal resting and squeeze pressures, although no significant difference of rectal sensation to distention with air was found. Pudendal nerve terminal latencies were obtained in seven patients and were all normal. In four patients latency could not be demonstrated due to poor contraction of the sphincter on stimulation of the pudendal nerve. Two of these patients were incontinent and two had both constipation and obstructed defecation. It is concluded that patients with voiding symptoms due to multiple sclerosis often reveal anorectal symptoms or motility disorders. Although anal sphincter function is reduced, fecal incontinence is not prevalent in this group. The reason for this lies probably in the fact that many of the patients are constipated, thus securing fecal continence. ',\n",

Intestinal perforation due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with AIDS is the most common life-threatening condition requiring emergency celiotomy in these patients. The authors describe a patient with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection, and review 14 additional cases reported in the English-language surgical literature. The diagnostic triad of pneumoperitoneum on x-ray, evidence or history of CMV infection, and AIDS occurred in 70 percent of patients. The most common site of intestinal perforation was the colon (53 percent), followed in frequency by the distal ileum (40 percent) and appendix (7 percent); perforation usually occurred between the distal ileum and splenic flexure of the colon. Colonoscopy, rather than sigmoidoscopy, is recommended as a screening examination in patients with AIDS suspected of having colonic ulceration due to CMV infection. Multiple biopsies of ulcerated tissue should be obtained. Gross and microscopic analyses of involved intestinal tissue reveal the characteristic findings of ulceration and CMV infection. Despite aggressive therapy, the operative mortality rate in patients with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection was 54 percent and the overall mortality rate was 87 percent. Postoperative complications occurred in most patients and consisted mainly of systemic sepsis and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii infection. An increased awareness of this syndrome by physicians frequently called on to manage patients with AIDS is recommended. ',\n",
       " '152': \"Circadian variations in myocardial ischemia. Implications for management. Extended ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in the patient's customary environment provides clear evidence of circadian patterns in myocardial ischemic episodes. In patients with effort angina, the highest activity occurs between 6 AM and noon. This coincides with peaks in diurnal variation of frequency of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death. A number of potential underlying common triggering mechanisms, including catecholamine secretion, sympathetic nervous system activity, blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol secretion, and aggregability of platelets, exhibit similar surges. As a result of these coinciding morning peaks, myocardial oxygen demand is increased and oxygen supply reduced after a person arises in the morning. Attention to this vulnerable period is merited in the timing and choice of medication, both to prevent or reduce ischemia and to modify potential disease-triggering mechanisms. \",\n",

The ratio of ankle-to-arm systolic blood pressure (ankle/arm index or AAI) appears to be a non-invasive indicator of flow-significant atherosclerosis and may be a useful measure of burden of disease in a high risk population. The prevalence of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) was assessed by this method in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). Subjects were aged 60 and older with systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg upon entry to the study. An AAI of 0.90 or less was considered indicative of flow-significant LEAD. The prevalence of LEAD by this method was 26.7% (50/187), while the prevalence of intermittent claudication (IC) was only 6.4% (12/187). Of those with IC, 66.7% (8/12) had confirmed LEAD. The prevalence of LEAD as measured by AAI increased with age in women and was associated with a history of current smoking and lower levels of high density lipoproteins. In this study population with systolic hypertension, LEAD, as measured by the AAI, is more prevalent than previously described in elderly populations and is associated with other risk factors for atherosclerosis.

Strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with deletions of the small RNA (EBER) genes were made by homologous recombination using the EBV P3HR-1 strain, which has undergone deletion of the essential transforming gene that encodes the EBV nuclear antigen, EBNA-2, and a DNA fragment that was wild type at the EBNA-2 locus but from which the EBER genes had been deleted. Even though the EBER and EBNA-2 genes are separated by 40 kilobases, selection for transforming P3HR-1 recombinants that required a restored EBNA-2 gene resulted in 20% cotransfer of the EBER deletion. EBER-deleted recombinants transformed primary B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which were indistinguishable form LCLs transformed by wild-type EBV in their proliferation, in latency-associated EBV gene expression, and in their permissiveness for EBV replication cycle gene expression. EBER-deleted virus from infected LCL clones could infect and growth-transform primary B lymphocytes. These procedures should be applicable to the construction of other EBV recombinants within 40 kilobases of the EBNA-2 gene.

In all cases the endoprostheses expanded to a diameter of 7 to 10 mm and achieved complete biliary tract drainage. Jaundice disappeared in 36 of the 39 patients. No early complication was observed. After a median follow-up of 121 days (range, 30 to 422 days), 19 of 36 patients are still alive and 17 died of non-procedure-related causes. Biliary re-obstruction occurred in five patients due to tumor overgrowth above or below the prosthesis (four patients) or bile encrustation (one patient). In patients with malignant stenoses, the probability of stent patency is 78% after 200 days.

       " '157': 'Pathogenesis and therapy of peptic ulcer disease. The epithelial cells of the stomach and duodenum are normally protected from the damaging effects of acid and pepsin by a balancing mechanism of mucosal resistance. If an imbalance occurs, peptic ulcer may result. Traditional teaching has emphasized the importance of acid (and pepsin) as the cause of this imbalance; however, it is clear that acid and pepsin are not the only important factors in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer. More recent investigative efforts have been directed at what constitutes mucosal resistance and how it can be disrupted to produce, in the presence of gastric acid, a peptic ulcer. Depletion of endogenous prostaglandins and Helicobacter pylori gastritis have emerged as prominent theories. As evidence exists both to support and refute these theories in humans, any definitive conclusions cannot be made at this time. The acute management of peptic ulcer disease is directed at relieving pain, accelerating ulcer healing, and preventing complications. Peptic ulcers can be healed with antisecretory agents (i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, omeprazole), antacids, prostaglandins, and sucralfate. Because they are effective, safe, and convenient, the H2-receptor antagonists are the most widely used agents for the management of peptic ulcer disease. Because the H2-receptor antagonist agents are equally effective in their indicated uses and are equally safe based on scientifically valid data, selection should be based primarily on cost. Omeprazole is the newest antisecretory agent: a single morning dose of 20 mg suppresses acid secretion for 24 h. The agent offers little advantage over H2-receptor antagonists for the majority of patients with peptic ulcer. ',\n",

We compared the pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) between 13 men with clinically and electrographically documented temporal lobe seizures and 8 age-matched controls. Serum for LH measurement was drawn every 15 minutes during 8 hours of EEG telemetry in both groups. The 2 groups did not differ significantly in average mean baseline LH secretion, total LH secretion, or average pulse amplitude. The group with seizures, however, showed a significantly greater (p less than 0.05) variability of baseline LH secretion and pulse frequency. Among the men with unilateral paroxysmal EEG findings, pulse frequency was significantly greater (p = 0.05) with right epileptiform discharges or left slowing (6.4 +/- 0.4) than with left epileptiform discharges or right slowing (3.0 +/- 1.3). The relationship of pulse frequency to the nature and laterality of paroxysmal discharges makes it unlikely that endocrine abnormalities can be attributed to medication alone and strengthens the notion that temporal lobe epileptiform discharges may disrupt hypothalamic regulation of pituitary secretion.

The erythrocyte folate and serum vitamin B12 levels were within normal limits in all of the patients. The serum ferritin level was elevated in 12. The xylose absorption test results were abnormal in 8 of the 13 patients able to complete the study. None of the duodenal aspirates yielded a pathogen. Light microscopy revealed nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation without infection in the stomach (in seven patients), the esophagus (in five), the duodenum (in two) and the rectum (in two). However, biopsy specimens were positive for Candida albicans in the esophagus (four patients), cytomegalovirus in the esophagus (one) and the rectum (two), Helicobacter pylori in the antrum (two), Treponema infection in the rectum (two) and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in the small intestine (one). Only three patients had a normal series of biopsy specimens. All of the patients had similar ultrastructural changes at the epithelial-stromal junction of the antral glands and in the intestinal crypts.

       " '163': 'General principles of therapy of pyogenic meningitis. In bacterial meningitis, several pharmacodynamic factors determine therapeutic success-when defined as sterilization of the CSF: (1) Local host defense deficits in the CNS require the use of bactericidal antibiotics to sterilize the CSF. (2) CSF antibiotic concentrations that are at least 10-fold above the MBC are necessary for maximal bactericidal activity. Protein binding, low pH, and slow bacterial growth rates are among the factors that may explain the high antibiotic concentrations necessary in vivo. (3) High CSF peak concentrations that lead to rapid bacterial killing appear more important than prolonged suprainhibitory concentrations, probably because very low residual levels in the CSF prevent bacterial regrowth, even during relatively long dosing intervals. (4) Penetration of antibiotics into the CSF is significantly impaired by the blood-brain barrier and thus, very high serum levels are necessary to achieve the CSF concentrations required for optimal bactericidal activity. Beyond these principles, recent data suggests that rapid lytic killing of bacteria in the CSF may have harmful effects on the brain because of the release of biologically active products from the lysed bacteria. Since rapid CSF sterilization remains a key therapeutic goal, the harmful consequences of bacterial lysis present a major challenge in the therapy of bacterial meningitis. Currently, dexamethasone represents that only clinically beneficial approach to reduce the harmful effects of bacterial lysis, and novel approaches are required to improve the outcome of this serious infection.

The 36 symptomatic episodes that occurred in 33 patients included fever in 20 episodes and fever combined with cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or rales in 16. Fourteen chest roentgenograms were interpreted as normal, and 22 were interpreted as demonstrating nonspecific changes; however, none of the roentgenograms was considered helpful in that they did not provide sufficient information for further management. In 2 of 14 episodes in patients with normal chest roentgenograms and in 9 of 22 episodes in patients with nonspecific chest roentgenograms, CT scanning resulted in a change in clinical management that included performing bronchoscopy, increasing or changing antibiotic coverage, starting white blood cell transfusions, requesting surgical biopsy, or a combination of these. In 1 of 14 episodes in patients with normal chest roentgenograms and in 8 of 22 episodes in patients with nonspecific roentgenograms, CT added confidence to the diagnosis. In the remaining 16 episodes, CT scans provided no additional information. We conclude that in many instances, noncontrast ultrafast chest CT scans can provide information that may either change a patient's clinical management or more clearly establish the extent of pulmonary disease. \",\n",

Overdistraction was maintained from 5 to 30 minutes after loss of NMEPs. Results suggest that the longer the duration of overdistraction the greater the likelihood of paraplegia. Blood flow measures indicated that reduced perfusion was greatest at the distraction site but extended proximally and distally. Finally, NMEPs were more sensitive to onset of overdistraction and a more valid indicator of paraplegia than SEPs. NMEPs should provide the surgeon with more time for initiation of intervention techniques than SEPs.

Prostheses were divided into four zones: head (including acetabulum), trochanter, shaft, and tip. The presence (or absence) and intensity of activity in each zone was noted, and compared to the corresponding contralateral zone. Though present in all 23 infected arthroplasties, periprosthetic activity was also present in 77% of uninfected arthroplasties, and was greater than the contralateral zone 51% of the time. When analyzed by zone, head zone activity was the best criterion for infection (87% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 92% accuracy). Fifty of the arthroplasties were studied with combined labeled leukocyte/sulfur colloid imaging. Using incongruence of images as the criterion for infection, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the study were 100%, 97%, and 98%, respectively.

Emergency ventricular shunting led to prompt neurological improvement, which, supplemented by radiation therapy, allowed long-term amelioration of symptoms. Three possible explanations for this complication are offered: 1) traction of the attached 3rd ventricle into the decompression site, causing increased obstructive hydrocephalus, 2) vasopressin release by surgical manipulation of the pituitary stalk and circumventricular organs causing cerebral edema, and 3) edema in the residual tumor secondary to surgical manipulation causing further hydrocephalus. Subsequent patients with similar clinical and imaging criteria will have a planned perioperative ventricular shunting procedure performed. ',\n",

This report illustrates the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify the initial extent of a cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma and, more importantly, its response to chemotherapy. Image slices spanning the heart and adjacent structures were analyzed using Simpson's rule applied to the image slices to estimate the tumor volume initially, then after 5 weeks, and again after 4 months of chemotherapy. A substantial, progressive reduction in tumor volume during chemotherapy was shown. After chemotherapy was discontinued, an increase in tumor volume was shown. It is suggested that, in addition to being useful in patient care, the technique may be useful in clinical investigations by providing an objective, quantitative measure of tumor response to therapy. \",\n",

Granulomatous muscle disease is most commonly seen in sarcoidosis, but may be seen in association with a wide variety of other disorders or in isolation. Patients with granulomatous myositis usually present with slowly progressive muscle pain and weakness affecting mainly proximal muscles. There are, however, a few reports of granulomatous muscle disease presenting with flexion contractures of the limbs. Two further patients with granulomatous muscle disease and flexion contractures of the limbs, but with no evidence of systemic granulomatous disease, is presented. It is suggested that such patients represent a separate clinical entity that is distinct from idiopathic granulomatous myositis presenting with muscle pain and weakness. The association of contracturing granulomatous myositis with a long-standing vasculitis in one patient suggests that the two conditions may be related. ',\n",

Thirty-two patients (Group I) had sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias 8 to 60 days (mean 13 +/- 9) after acute myocardial infarction. The remaining 76 patients (Group II), who served as a control group, had no sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias less than or equal to 60 days after infarction. The most significant independent determinants of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias late after infarction were the presence of late potentials (chi square = 16.07, p = 0.0001), defined as an abnormal signal-averaged QRS complex in association with an abnormal root-mean-square voltage in the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex, and an abnormal ejection fraction of less than 40% (chi square = 10.09, p = 0.001).

In an effort to explain the increased sensitivity to agonists of hypertrophic vascular muscle, intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)-signaling mechanisms were studied in normal and hypertrophic rat aortas from normotensive and coarctation-hypertensive rats. Based on both fura 2 fluorescence and aequorin luminescence measurements, qualitatively different patterns of Ca2+ mobilization occur in normal and hypertrophic rat aortic muscle. Normal rat aortic muscle contracts to phenylephrine with little or no increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas the angiotensin II-induced contraction is accompanied by a marked [Ca2+]i transient. In contrast, hypertrophic rat aortic muscle shows a dramatic increase in Ca2+ signaling after phenylephrine stimulation. Moreover, both the amplitude of the angiotensin-induced [Ca2+]i transient and the contractile sensitivity to this agonist are decreased in the hypertrophic muscle. Our results strongly suggest that the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient after agonist stimulation determines the contractile sensitivity and that there is an altered coupling of the alpha-adrenoceptor in the hypertrophic vascular muscle.

The preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels were predictive of recurrence and survival independent of the tumor stage. In a multivariate regression analysis of age, location, tumor stage, and preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, the latter three factors were significant prognostic variables with respect to the adjusted survival. Recurrent disease was found in 42% of patients, excluding patients with stage IV disease. The carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was greater than 5 ng/mL in 79% of the patients and in 89% of the intra-abdominal recurrences. Carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence was not predictive of postrecurrence survival except in the subgroup of locoregional disease. The life span in patients with liver and lung metastases was not influenced by carcinoembryonic antigen level at recurrence. Preoperative and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels can indicate a poorer prognostic group of patients with colorectal cancer who may benefit from adjuvant treatment.

Susceptibility difference in T cells of various phenotypes and functions and its relevance to immunosuppression in the tumor-bearing state. The present study investigates the nature of humoral component(s) generated in tumor-bearing hosts to induce immune dysfunction of T cells. Cell-free ascitic fluid and culture supernatant (SN) were obtained from the ascites and cultures allowing MH134 hepatoma cells to grow. These ascites and SN samples were tested for their abilities to influence the generation of CTL responses to TNP and alloantigens. The generation of the anti-TNP CTL responses that require self H-2-restricted CD4+ Th cells was markedly suppressed by addition of the ascites or SN under conditions in which these samples did not inhibit anti-allo CTL responses capable of using alternate pathways of allo-restricted CD4+ and CD8+ Th. The activation of CD8+ CTL precursors and CTL activity were also resistant to the ascites or SN. The ascites- or SN-induced suppressive effect to which CD4+ Th were most susceptible was found to be mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) activity, because: 1) the TGF-beta activity was detected in the MH134 ascites and culture SN; 2) the suppression of CD4+ Th function required for anti-TNP CTL responses was almost completely prevented by addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody to cultures and; 3) rTGF-beta also induced similar patterns of immunosuppression to those observed by ascites or SN. These results indicate that TGF-beta produced by tumor cells induces deleterious effects on T cell, especially on the CD4+ Th subset, and provide an explanation for the molecular mechanism underlying the previously observed CD4+ Th-selective suppression in the tumor-bearing state.

In group 1, 13 of 15 rats had high-grade adhesions in both models. In group 2, high-grade adhesions were noted in nine of 15 rats in model 1 and in 12 of 15 rats in model 2. In group 3, however, high-grade adhesions were seen in only three of 15 rats in model 1, with 11 rats having no adhesions, and in only two of 15 rats in model 2. Histologic analysis suggested accelerated healing in group 3. We conclude that (1) fibrin glue inhibits intra-abdominal adhesion formation in rats, (2) the inhibitory action is dependent on the fibrinogen concentration of the fibrin glue, and (3) adhesions are reduced by fibrin glue regardless of whether the peritoneal defect is closed.

After stroke had occurred, the rats were divided into three groups: 1) parathyroidectomy, 2) nimodipine, and 3) controls. In the nimodipine group, the rats survived longer than those in the other groups. Blood pressure of the controls did not differ from the nimodipine-treated and parathyroidectomy animals. The increase in calcium content of brain and kidney tissues and of plasma renin activity, urea, and creatinine was attenuated by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy. The histology of the kidneys revealed widespread fibrinoid necrosis of arteries in all rats. In the nimodipine-treated or parathyroidectomy groups, healing of the lesions was detectable. Cerebral lesions were mainly characterized by fibrinoid necrosis. Nimodipine-treated as well as parathyroidectomied animals showed significantly fewer hypertensive cerebral lesions.

Several time and frequency domain measures of heart period variability are reduced 1 to 2 weeks after myocardial infarction, and a reduced standard deviation of normal RR intervals over a 24 h period (SDNN) is associated with increased mortality. The predictive accuracy of heart period variability may be reduced by drugs used to treat patients after myocardial infarction. Accordingly, a randomized, three period, placebo-controlled, crossover (Latin square) design was used to determine the effect of atenolol and diltiazem on time and frequency measures of heart period variability calculated from 24 h continuous electrocardiographic recordings during treatment with atenolol, diltiazem and placebo in 18 normal volunteers. During atenolol treatment, the 24 h average normal RR (NN) interval increased 24% (p less than 0.001). The three measures of tonic vagal activity were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) during atenolol treatment: percent of successive normal RR intervals greater than 50 ms = 69%, root mean square successive difference of normal RR intervals = 61% and high frequency power in the heart period power spectrum = 84%. Low frequency power also increased 45% (p less than 0.01), indicating that this variable also is an indicator of tonic vagal activity over 24 h. Diltiazem had no significant effect on the 24 h average NN interval or on any measure of heart period variability. The decreased mortality rate after myocardial infarction associated with beta-adrenergic blocker but not calcium channel blocker therapy may be attributed in part to an increase in vagal tone caused by beta-blockers.

Delayed serologic transfusion reactions (DSTRs) and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) were studied in a large tertiary-care hospital. A DSTR was defined by the posttransfusion finding of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and a newly developed alloantibody specificity. A DHTR was defined as a DSTR case that showed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Thirty-four cases of DSTR, 70 percent of which were due to anti-E and/or -Jka, were documented prospectively over a 20-month period. Retrospective review of the medical records found clinical evidence of hemolysis in only 6 (18%) of the 34. Thus, the incidence of DSTR was 1 (0.66%) of 151 recipients with posttransfusion samples available for testing, whereas the incidence of DHTR was only 1 (0.12%) of 854 patients tested. Fifteen of the 34 patients were followed for up to 174 days after reaction. Twelve of the 15 still demonstrated a positive DAT with anti-IgG only. Eluate studies indicated that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR may involve several immunologic mechanisms, including the development of posttransfusion autoantibodies. This study indicates 1) that DSTRs are a frequent finding in multiply transfused patients, although most cases are benign and fail to meet rigid criteria for DHTR, and 2) that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR is common.

Congenic mouse strains were tested in the lymphocyte proliferation assay for their response to the purified surface protease of Leishmania mexicana (gp63).

Mice of the C57BL/10 (B10) background carrying H-2 haplotypes b,q, and r were found to be high responders; those carrying H-2 haplotypes d, j, v, and z were low responders; and those with H-2a, H-2f, H-2k, H-2p, and H-2u haplotypes were intermediate responders. Studies with H-2 recombinant strains indicated that the high responsiveness on the B10 background was determined by the Ab allele and the low responsiveness influenced by the Ad allele. Other genes besides H-2 appear to have a role in the immune response as shown by the fact that some strains with BALB, DBA, or C3H background differed in their pattern of responsiveness from B10 background strains carrying the corresponding H-2 haplotypes. By using recombinant protein, the influence of the leishmanial surface lipophosphoglycan that might co-purify with gp63, on the MHC restriction of the response to gp63 was excluded.

The present study was designed to verify the attentional performance of patients with parietal lesions in the experimental condition in which they had to pay attention to 3 spatial positions located on the left, on the right and directly above the fixation stimulus (Experiment 1) and to only 1 of the 3 spatial positions at a time (Experiment 2). Twelve patients (6 subjects with right parietal lesions and 6 subjects without neurological deficits) participated in the experiment. The results of Experiment 1 showed that in patients with right parietal lesions the speed and accuracy of response to horizontally aligned stimuli increased gradually from right to left, whereas the control group showed only the effect due to the different retinal eccentricities of the 3 stimuli, that is, responses to central stimuli were faster and more accurate than responses to left and right stimuli. The results of Experiment 2 showed that both the neurological and control groups were faster to respond to central than to left and right stimuli, and that the neurological group was faster to respond to right than left stimuli, whereas no difference in RTs between two visual fields was obtained in the control group. Furthermore, when the patients had to respond to 3 spatial locations aligned horizontally (Experiment 1), the speed and accuracy of response to the right stimulus were the same as when they had to focus attention on it (Experiment 2). These results showed that the focus of attention in patients with visual extinction is on the rightmost stimulus and that the increased attention to the right is accompanied by a decreased attention to the left.

Striatocapsular infarction has recently been described as a distinct stroke entity and forms an important subgroup of subcortical infarctions. In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis.

There were 22 women and 3 men, with a mean age of 51 +/- 14 years (range, 27 to 74). Hemodynamic and angiographic findings were evaluated before and after PMV and clinical status was assessed at follow-up. There was a significant decrease in mitral gradient following PMV, from 15.4 +/- 5.1 to 5.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (p less than .0001); an increase in cardiac output, from 4.6 +/- 1.1 to 5.2 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than .01); and an increase in calculated mitral valve area, from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.2 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p less than 0.0001).

In lungs pretreated with meclofenamate (3 microM), the endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and ionophore A23187 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were examined during conditions of increased tone by U46619 (50 pmol/min). Acetylcholine or A23187 produced dose-dependent vasodilation in control lungs, this response was reduced in group 1W-H (P less than 0.02), abolished in group 3W-H (P less than 0.001), and restored in group 3WH + R. In contrast, the endothelium-independent vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside remained fully active in group 3W-H. The pressor response to 300 pM endothelin was greater in group 3W-H than in controls (6.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) but was not potentiated by the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) antagonists: hydroquinone (10(-4) M); methylene blue (10(-4) M); and pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M) as it was in controls. It was similar to controls in group 3W-H + R.

After a preliminary dose-finding study involving 12 patients with advanced or locally recurrent head and neck cancer, 27 patients were treated on a phase II protocol, using fluorouracil 350 mg/m2/d by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 days, followed on the sixth day by a 2-hour IV infusion of cisplatin 50 mg/m2, administered during the first and fourth weeks of radiation therapy to total doses between 60 and 64 Gy, using 2 Gy daily fractions. Eight of these 27 patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (AJCC) stage III disease, and 12 had stage IV disease. Four had recurrent disease after surgery. Three-year follow-up is now available. Twenty-one (77.8%) remitted completely following treatment, and 11 remain free of local and regional relapse at 3 years. Four have developed systemic metastases. Following successful salvage treatment in two cases, estimated determinate survival at 3 years is 64%. Acute toxicity was manageable with this regime. Eleven instances of grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) mucositis were observed, which caused interruptions to radiotherapy in only four cases. No late sequelae have so far been recorded. It is concluded that the protocol described is tolerable but probably did not cause a greater number of locoregional \"cures\" than would have been expected following conventional radiotherapy alone in this group of patients. The use of infusional fluorouracil with concurrent conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin infusion results in mucositis that limits the dose of fluorouracil to levels that are probably subtherapeutic.

Nine patients with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation underwent this operation; four patients had chronic atrial fibrillation and five had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the mean duration of symptoms was 12 +/- 8 years. Patient ages ranged from 25 to 68 years (mean 48 +/- 12). At preoperative electrophysiologic study, no patient had evidence of an accessory AV pathway or AV node reentry. Sinus node recovery time could not be determined in five patients because of recurrent atrial fibrillation during or before programmed stimulation. At operation the corridor of atrial tissue connecting the sinus and AV nodes was successfully isolated from the remaining left and right atrial tissue in all patients. One patient required early reoperation for recurrent atrial fibrillation before hospital discharge. At the predischarge electrophysiologic study, the corridor remained isolated in all patients except for one patient who had intermittent conduction between the corridor and excluded right atrium. One patient had nonsustained atrial fibrillation and one had atrial tachycardia evident in the corridor. Atypical AV node reentry of uncertain significance was induced in one other patient.

The objectives of the present experiments were to study the effects of long-term low-dose nicotine treatment on skin hemodynamics, viability, and microvascular morphology in 4 x 10 cm dorsally based acute random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. In addition, the reversibility of the nicotine-induced detrimental effects on skin-flap viability following cessation of nicotine treatment also was investigated. Low-dose nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) administered twice daily and subcutaneously for 24 weeks significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased skin-flap capillary blood flow, distal perfusion, and length and area of skin viability compared with the saline-treated control (n = 15). However, these same parameters in rats (n = 15) whose nicotine treatment had been withheld for 2 weeks prior to skin-flap surgery were not significantly different from the control, thus indicating that the detrimental effects of this long-term, low-dose nicotine treatment were reversible. The mean plasma level of nicotine in the nicotine-treated rats was 8.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl and was within the range of plasma nicotine levels reported for human heavy cigarette smokers. Light and electron microscopic studies did not show evidence of histologic damage to the cutaneous microvasculature in acute random-pattern skin flaps and samples of normal (nonoperated) skin in nicotine-treated rats. It is concluded that long-term plasma levels of nicotine similar to those of heavy cigarette smokers are detrimental to the capillary blood flow and viability of random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. These deleterious effects can be avoided if skin flaps are raised 2 weeks after cessation of nicotine treatment. This low-dose nicotine treatment does not cause histologic damage to the microvasculature. Other pathogenic mechanisms of nicotine-induced skin flap ischemia are discussed. ',\n",

In chronic disease situations where treatment comparisons favor no particular therapy, or where definitive outcome requires a considerable follow-up period, it is useful to have additional and perhaps intermediate endpoints of relevant clinical significance to compare treatments. One such endpoint is Time Without Symptoms and Toxicity (TWiST) which, together with Q-TWiST, attempts to address the quality of life of patients receiving the competing regimens. This paper provides a commentary on these techniques with an emphasis on the problems inherent in implementing Q-TWiST, a measure that attempts to incorporate patient value preferences into TWiST. It is argued that while Q-TWiST is intuitively appealing in the clinical setting, there are formidable design and psychometric hurdles that must be overcome to fully operationalize the concept.

The fractional catabolic rate of 68 (19)% of the plasma pool per day was more rapid than other reported human plasma proteins. All radioactivity was excreted in the urine by 14 d. In 16 patients with monoclonal gammopathy or chronic inflammatory diseases, but without amyloidosis, 125I-SAP metabolism was normal. However, among 45 patients with biopsy-proven systemic amyloidosis (25, amyloid A type; 20, amyloid L type), 125I-SAP was cleared from the plasma more rapidly, accumulated in the amyloid deposits, and persisted there. The T1/2 in amyloid, measured directly with 131I-SAP, was 24 d. Repeat studies after 6-18 mo were notably consistent in normals but changed significantly in amyloid patients, generally correlating with clinical signs of disease progression. Measurements of 125I-SAP turnover may thus be of value for diagnosis and monitoring of amyloidosis. Analysis of SAP metabolism in amyloidosis suggests that plasma SAP is in dynamic equilibrium with a very large amyloid pool, and in two autopsies the total mass of SAP in the amyloid deposits was 2,100 and 21,000 mg, respectively.

Yet, with this progress there has been a groundswell of protest at the rapidly escalating costs of health care. More than $600 billion was spent on health care in 1989 and estimates of $1.5 trillion are made for the year 2000. Repeated attempts at cost containment have failed. It has been suggested that only by retarding technologic advances will we be able to control costs. Many observers believe that rationing of health care is the only solution, but new technology not only improves cancer care, it often decreases cost. It is not rational to retard advances that may later reduce costs, nor is it humane to retard advances that improve care, even if they cost more. In identifying priorities we should begin with the principle that treatments be restricted to clinical trials unless they have been demonstrated to prolong survival or improve the quality of life. If the payers reimburse procedures in an investigative setting, they will be on firm ground when they deny support for those same procedures outside an investigative setting. This is both an ethical and a fiscally responsible position for the third parties to take. It will not be easy for the profession or for the payers to deal with these problems. Public education and patient education will be key elements of any solution. Shifting the blame from politician to payer to professional will only make the problems worse. ',\n",

Nearly 50% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will initially have nondiagnostic ECGs on ED presentation. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs could be identified using new immunochemical assays for serial CK-MB sampling in the ED. DESIGN: Chest pain patients, more than 30 years old, with pain not caused by trauma or explained by radiographic findings, were eligible for the study. Serial serum samples were drawn on ED presentation (zero hours) and three hours after presentation, then analyzed for CK-MB using four immunochemical methods and electrophoresis. Standard World Health Organization criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of AMI, including new Q-wave formation or elevation of standard in-hospital serum cardiac enzyme markers. SETTING: A tertiary cardiac care community hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The serum from 183 patients hospitalized for possible ischemic chest pain was collected and analyzed. Thirty-one of 183 patients (17%) were found to have AMI by standard in-hospital criteria. Sixteen of the 31 patients (52%) with AMI had nondiagnostic ECGs on presentation. Immunochemical determination of serial CK-MB levels provided a sensitive and specific method for detecting AMI in patients within three hours after ED presentation compared with standard electrophoresis. The four immunochemical methods demonstrated a range in sensitivity from 50% to 62.1% on ED presentation versus 92% to 96.7% three hours later. The immunochemical tests demonstrated specificities ranging from 83.0% to 96.4% at three hours, with three of the four tests having specificities of 92% or greater. Electrophoresis had a sensitivity of 34.5% on ED presentation, increasing to 76.9% at three hours, with a specificity of 98.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Immunochemical CK-MB methods allowed rapid, sensitive detection of AMI in the ED. Early detection of AMI offers many potential advantages to the emergency physician. Early detection of AMI, while the patient is in the ED, could direct disposition of this potentially unstable patient to an intensive care setting. Such information may prevent the ED discharge of patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs. The diagnosis of AMI within a six-hour period after symptom onset may allow thrombolytic therapy to be given to patients with AMI not having diagnostic ECGs. This study served as a pilot trial for a multicenter study of the Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research Group, which is currently ongoing. ',\n",

Three hundred seven patients (56%) had upper-third lesions (proximal carcinoma), whereas 71 (13%) and 101 (18%), respectively, had middle-third and lower-third bile duct carcinomas. The remaining patients had diffuse lesions. Resectability rates were 32% for upper-third localization compared to 47% and 51% for middle-third and lower-third localization, respectively. The operative mortality rate for proximal carcinomas was significantly lower with resection (16%) compared with palliative surgery (31%) (p less than 0.05). Overall 1-year survival (operative deaths excluded) was 68% after tumor resection compared to 31% after palliative surgery (p less than 0.001). Long-term results after surgical resection correlated with local and regional extension of the disease.

The mean tubular diameter after DT was 220 +/- 37 mu compared with 303.1 +/- 10.7 mu for ST testes (p less than 0.02). The testicular biopsy score based upon the morphology of the spermatic tubules was 4.46 +/- 3.32 for DT testes and 8.65 +/- 0.23 for ST testes (p less than 0.02) compared with 8.38 +/- 0.18 for contralateral testes and an absolute normal value of 10. No morphologic abnormalities were observed in the contralateral unoperated testes from any of the rats. The contralateral testes in 12 additional rats were removed before DT. The mean testosterone values in these rats with one testicle was 1.43 +/- 0.75 ng/mL. Three weeks after DT, testosterone values were 0.19 +/- 0.31 ng/mL (p less than 0.01). It is concluded that division of the main spermatic artery and vein in rats produces testicular atrophy with spermatogenic arrest and interstitial cell dysfunction. Although collateral blood flow to the testis may be demonstrated, tissue perfusion is inadequate for normal spermatogenesis and endocrine function. ',\n",
       " '231': 'Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a clinical and EEG study of five cases. In five children with normal initial psychomotor development, a Landau-Kleffner syndrome appeared at age 3-7 years. No neuroanatomic lesions were noted. Aphasia and hyperkinesia were isolated in three patients and associated with global regression of higher cortical functions in one patient. Massive intellectual deterioration and psychotic behavior were associated with transient aphasia in one patient. The epilepsy (focal motor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, subclinical EEG focal seizures during sleep, and atypical absences) always regressed spontaneously or with antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The EEG in waking patients showed focal and generalized spike-wave discharges on a normal background rhythm. Discharge topography and pattern changed frequently. During sleep, discharges always increased. At some time during syndrome development, all patients had bilateral spike-waves for greater than 85% of the sleep period, while at other times the discharges were discontinuous or continuous but focal or unilaterally hemispheric. Discharge topography and abundance changed from night to night. The abnormal EEG and the impaired higher functions developed and regressed together, but not with strict temporal correlation. Our own experience suggests that the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and epilepsy with continuous spike-wave activity in slow-wave sleep cannot be clearly differentiated. They may be different points on the spectrum of a single syndrome. ',\n",
       " '232': 'Cholangiocarcinoma. The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma can now be made with greater rapidity and accuracy. In the clinical setting of obstructive jaundice, a CT scan or sonogram may suggest cholangiocarcinoma if dilated intrahepatic ducts are seen with a nondilated extrahepatic biliary tree. The diagnosis is confirmed by cholangiography, and the tumor is staged by the combination of cholangiography and angiography. If the tumor extensively involves both lobes of the liver or involves the main portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion is considered unresectable. These patients are best palliated nonoperatively, but they should still have an attempt at a tissue diagnosis, as various other lesions can masquerade as cholangiocarcinoma. In comparison, if the tumor is confined to or is distal to the hepatic duct bifurcation, extends into only one lobe of the liver, or involves only the right or the left portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion may be resectable, and exploration is indicated. As many as half of all patients explored with curative intent will have a successful resection. Various surgical options are appropriate for patients undergoing tumor resection, depending on the site and extent of the lesion. Similarly, several surgical options are possible for palliation in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The role of radiotherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma is uncertain. Our results, like those of many other retrospective analyses, suggest that radiotherapy prolongs survival after curative resection as well as after palliative stenting. However, further data from randomized studies are necessary to support or refute this impression. Further studies of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will also be necessary to improve patient survival. ',\n",

Men were randomly assigned to either a special intervention (SI) program, which consisted of dietary advice for lowering blood cholesterol levels, counseling aimed at cessation for cigarette smokers, and stepped-care treatment for hypertension for those with elevated blood pressure, or to their usual sources of health care within the community (UC). Among the 12,866 randomized men, 8,012 (62%) were hypertensive at baseline. For this subgroup, mortality rates with 10.5 years of follow-up were lower for the SI than for the UC group by 15% (p = 0.19) for CHD and 11% (p = 0.13) for all causes. These results reflected more favorable outcomes for SI compared with UC hypertensive men during the 3.8 posttrial years (March 1982 through December 1985) than during the preceding 6-8 years (through February 1982). During the posttrial years, death rates were lower for SI than for UC men by 26% (p = 0.09) for CHD and 23% (p = 0.02) for all causes. For those with diastolic blood pressure equal to or more than 100 mm Hg, this posttrial trend was a continuation of a trend during the trial; therefore, with 10.5 years of follow-up, death rates were markedly lower for SI than for UC by 36% (p = 0.07) for CHD and 50% (p = 0.0001) for all causes. Similarly, for those without baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities, the favorable posttrial outcome for the SI group was a continuation of a trend during the trial. In contrast, for those with baseline diastolic blood pressure of 90-99 mm Hg and for those with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities, the favorable posttrial mortality findings for the SI group were a reversal of unfavorable trends recorded during the trial. Two factors appear to have contributed to this more favorable mortality trend for the SI group: 1) a change in the diuretic treatment protocol for SI men about 5 years after randomization, which involved replacement of hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone at a daily maximum dose of 50 mg; and 2) a favorable effect of intervention on nonfatal cardiovascular events during the trial years. In addition, delay until the full impact of beneficial effects on mortality end points from smoking cessation and cholesterol lowering could have contributed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). ',\n",

The indications, morbidity, and efficacy of combined reconstruction of the abdominal aorta and visceral arteries (renal and superior mesenteric; excluding suprarenal aortic aneurysms) were analyzed retrospectively in 29 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from June 1984 through February 1990. Seventeen men and 12 women ages 32 to 76 years (mean, 66 years) were studied. Follow-up was complete in all patients to either death or calendar year 1989 to 1990 (mean, 31.9 months; range, 2 to 66 months). All patients underwent bypass of angiographically proven severe lesions of one renal artery (19 patients), both renal arteries (8 patients), or the superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries (2 patients), in concert with synthetic distal aortic replacement for occlusive disease (10 patients) or aneurysm (19 patients). Indications for renal artery repair included severe hypertension in 13 patients, ischemic renal insufficiency in 8 patients, and lesion morphology alone in 8 patients. Operative mortality rate was 3 of 29 (10.3%), and each death was the result of multisystem organ failure. Nonfatal complications occurred in 11 of the 26 survivors (42%), and this group differed significantly from the uncomplicated 15 patients only in having a higher mean preoperative serum creatinine (2.5 +/- 1.1 mg/dl vs 1.6 +/- 0.9 mg/dl, p = 0.04, t test). The mortality rate of patients with preoperative serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl, was 15.4% (2/13 patients), compared to 6.2% (1/16) in patients with creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dl. Three late deaths occurred (2 stroke, 1 cancer). Hypertension control improved in 64% of patients overall, and in 7 of 9 patients whose major operative indication was renovascular hypertension. Renal function remained stable or improved in 12 of 15 patients (80%) with renal insufficiency, but 3 patients progressed to require dialysis. Long-term graft patency was demonstrated by angiography or on duplex scan in all studied survivors (21 patients). Although operative risks are clearly increased compared to less complex vascular procedures, careful patient selection and management will yield a favorable outcome in most patients with such combined lesions.

Inhaled pentamidine is used commonly to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. Case reports indicate that PCP can recur in patients who receive inhaled pentamidine and that clinical features may be atypical. To determine the magnitude of this problem, we reviewed retrospectively the medical records of patients with proven PCP during a 30-month period at two hospitals. Four (31 percent) of 13 patients with previous PCP who received inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis had recurrent P carinii infection, including one patient with widely metastatic extrapulmonary disease. Chest roentgenographic findings included cavities, pneumothoraces, bilateral and upper lobe interstitial infiltrates, and pleural effusion. False-negative bronchoalveolar lavage and induced sputum examinations were frequent. We conclude that recurrent PCP in patients maintained on a regimen of inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis occurs frequently, causes chest roentgenographic abnormalities other than interstitial infiltrates, and may be difficult to diagnose. Clinicians who choose to use this effective and convenient mode of prophylaxis should be aware of the problems attendant to its use. ',\n",

Two hundred and seventy-seven patients with advanced carcinoma of the stomach invading the serosa were studied with regard to the relationship between the length of the serosal invasion (LSI) and prognosis, with a division made between expanding and infiltrative types of tumors. Among patients with expanding types of tumors, five year survival rates were 40 per cent in patients with LSI less than 4.0 centimeters, 33 per cent in patients with LSI 4.1 to 6.0 centimeters and 13.0 per cent in patients with LSI more than 6.0 centimeters. Among those patients with infiltrative types of tumors, those with less than 2.0 centimeters of LSI had a better prognosis (five year survival rate of 53 per cent), whereas those patients with a LSI more than 2.0 centimeters had a very poor prognosis (five year survival rate of less than 20 per cent) and the significant LSI on prognosis was found to be 2.0 centimeters.

Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 56 patients with mitral valve prolapse: 15 patients, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 39), died suddenly and mitral valve prolapse was the only cardiac condition found at necropsy (hereafter called isolated mitral valve prolapse); the remaining 41 patients had other conditions that were capable of being fatal. Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated congenital heart disease, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital cardiac abnormalities. Compared with the 34 patients without associated congenital heart disease and with nonmitral valve prolapse conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of mitral regurgitation (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02).

In the anesthetized closed-chest canine model of Gram-negative endotoxemia (n = 10), we tested the hypothesis that the effect of cardiac cycle-specific intrathoracic pressure pulses delivered by a heart rate-(HR) synchronized high-frequency jet ventilator (sync HFJV) on systolic ventricular performance is dependent on the level of preload. To control for HFJV frequency, hemodynamic responses were also measured at fixed frequency within 15% of HR (async HFJV). Biventricular stroke volumes (SV) were measured by electromagnetic flow probes. Measurements were made before (baseline) and 30 min after infusion of 1 mg/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin (serotype 055:B5) and then after 2 mg/kg propranolol at both low (less than 10 mmHg) left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) and high (greater than 10 mmHg) LVFP. Ventricular function curves, aortic pressure-flow (P-Q) relationships, and venous return (VR) curves were analyzed. We found that endotoxin did not alter VR curves but shifted the aortic P-Q curves to the left with pressure on the x-axis (P less than 0.05). Volume loading increased SV (P less than 0.01) because of a rightward shift of the VR curve. No specific differences occurred with either sync or async HFJV during endotoxin, presumably because of preserved VR and shifted aortic P-Q. The lack of cardiac cycle-specific effects of ITP appears to be due to the selective endotoxin-induced changes in peripheral vasomotor tone that counterbalance any depressed myocardial contractility.

In previous studies, we found that biliary scintigraphy with technetium-99m-labeled iminodiacetic acid ([99mTc]IDA) provided excellent discrimination between intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis, except in patients with profound cholestasis who had poor visualization of the biliary tree. In this study, we have used deconvolution analysis to determine the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) of a hypothetical single circulatory pass of [99mTc]IDA. Our hypothesis was that extraction of radionuclide from the blood would be normal in patients with extrahepatic obstruction alone, but would be impaired in patients with intrahepatic disease (IHD). The purpose of this study was to compare the HEF in patients with profound cholestasis (bilirubin greater than or equal to 3.0 mg/dl) due to either IHD or common bile duct obstruction (CBDO). Normal subjects (N = 13) had an HEF of 100%. Patients with CBDO (N = 13) had slightly reduced HEF values (92.8 +/- 3.2%) despite profound hyperbilirubinemia (6.1 +/- 1.0 mg/dl). Patients with IHD (N = 23) had a markedly reduced HEF (43.1 +/- 4.1%) which was significantly lower than patients with CBDO and normal subjects (P less than 0.001).

Native Indian children were represented in group 1 quite out of proportion to the referral population and had the most severe disease. While it is established that a higher prevalence of asymptomatic H. pylori infection exists in non-Caucasians, this appears to be the first demonstration of a higher prevalence of symptomatic ulcer disease in non-Caucasian children or adults. Caucasian children tended to have primary H. pylori gastritis (group 2) or duodenal ulcer without H. pylori (group 3). Antral nodularity was found to be an important specific endoscopic sign, unique to those children with H. pylori disease. It has not been described in adult H. pylori disease.

We have identified a region of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter that is necessary for maximal constitutive, virus-induced, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription. This region contains three sites that match an NF-kappa B binding-site consensus sequence. We show that these three sites specifically bind NF-kappa B in vitro, yet each of these sites can be deleted from the TNF-alpha promoter with little effect on the induction of the gene by virus or LPS. Moreover, when multimers of these three sites are placed upstream from a truncated TNF-alpha promoter, or a heterologous promoter, an increase in the basal level of transcription is observed that is influenced by sequence context and cell type. However, these multimers are not sufficient for virus or LPS induction of either promoter. Thus, unlike other virus- and LPS-inducible promoters that contain NF-kappa B binding sites, these sites from the TNF-alpha promoter are neither required nor sufficient for virus or LPS induction. Comparison of the sequence requirements of virus induction of the human TNF-alpha gene in mouse L929 and P388D1 cells reveals significant differences, indicating that the sequence requirements for virus induction of the gene are cell type-specific.

Thyrotropin is known to induce growth and differentiation in cultured thyroid cells, whereas the carcinogenic phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) causes dedifferentiation and malignant transformation in many cell lines. We therefore assessed the effect of thyrotropin and TPA on the actin architecture of FTC-133 human follicular thyroid cancer cells in continuous culture. Staining of filamentous actin with rhodamine phalloidin showed that 1 mU/ml or 30 mU/ml thyrotropin-induced actin polymerization was detectable at 1 hour but more notable at 24 hours. Similarly TPA (0.008 to 10 mumol/L) caused rapid actin fiber disruption and redistribution to the cell periphery. Secondary antibody staining for alpha-actinin, a protein that binds and crosslinks actin, was more prominent after treatment with thyrotropin but decreased after TPA. These findings indicate that the actin cytoskeleton has a dynamic response to trophic factors. Thyrotropin promoted actin polymerization, but TPA caused depolymerization. These effects may correlate with cellular alpha-actinin levels. Actin architecture may therefore reflect the state of differentiation of thyroid tumor cells. ',\n",

A study of biliary shock wave lithotripsy of gallstones sponsored by Dornier Medical Systems, Munich, began in the United States in May 1988 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and the need for adjunctive therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). One hundred forty-one symptomatic patients with one to three gallstones 5-30 mm in diameter were randomized to treatment. One week before ESWL, patients were given either UDCA or placebo. This treatment was continued for 6 months. All patients underwent follow-up at predetermined intervals. According to the protocol, re-treatment for fragments larger than 5 mm in diameter could be performed only at 6 weeks; 26 (18%) of the 141 patients were retreated. At 6 months, the stone-free rates for single stones were as follows: patients with noncalcified stones receiving UDCA, 29%; patients with noncalcified stones receiving placebo, 24%; and patients with partially calcified stones receiving either UDCA or placebo, 6%. No significant difference was noted between the UDCA and placebo groups. At 6 months, the stone-free rates in patients with single, noncalcified stones 20 mm or less in diameter were 40% (UDCA) and 32% (placebo), which is superior to rates for those with solitary, noncalcified gallstones 21-30 mm in diameter and those with two or three stones.

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of ondansetron with those of high-dose metoclopramide in treating acute and delayed cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. SETTING: Conducted at two university hospitals, a cancer institute, and six community hospitals. PATIENTS: Of 125 patients, 95 were evaluable for the acute phase and 79 for the delayed phase. Major reasons for not being evaluable were no second course (14 patients), protocol violation (5 patients), and change in cisplatin dose (3 patients) for the acute phase, and rescue medication on day 1 (7 patients), protocol violation (3 patients), and inadequate data (4 patients) for the delayed phase. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received cisplatin, 50 to 100 mg/m2 body surface area (median, 75 mg/m2); none had previously received chemotherapy. Thirty minutes before the cisplatin administration, ondansetron was given intravenously over 15 minutes, at a loading dose of 8 mg followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mg/h for 24 hours. Metoclopramide was given at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg body weight, followed by a continuous infusion for 8 hours (4 mg/kg). For the delayed phase (days 2 through 6), the first oral dose was given as soon as the infusion was completed; the oral dose consisted of either metoclopramide, 20 mg three times daily, or ondansetron, 8 mg three times daily for another 5 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the acute phase, a major or complete response was seen in 72% of the ondansetron-treated and 41% of the metoclopramide-treated patients (P less than 0.001). Nausea was significantly better controlled among the ondansetron-treated patients (P = 0.04). In the delayed phase, no statistically significant difference was seen between ondansetron- and metoclopramide-treated patients. Nausea was significantly better controlled with metoclopramide (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron is significantly more effective than metoclopramide in preventing acute nausea and vomiting. In the delayed phase, the results of both drugs were disappointing, although metoclopramide's effect on delayed nausea was superior. Patients preferred ondansetron. \",\n",
       " '260': 'Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging. Does 24-hour delayed imaging after reinjection enhance detection of viable myocardium? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection immediately after conventional stress-redistribution imaging improves the detection of viable myocardium, as many myocardial regions with apparently \"irreversible\" thallium defects on standard 3-4-hour redistribution images manifest enhanced thallium uptake after reinjection. Because the 10-minute period between reinjection and imaging may be too short, the present study was designed to determine whether 24-hour imaging after thallium reinjection provides additional information regarding myocardial viability beyond that obtained by imaging shortly after reinjection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 50 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease undergoing exercise thallium tomography, radionuclide angiography, and coronary arteriography. Immediately after the 3-4-hour redistribution images were obtained, 1 mCi thallium was injected at rest, and images were reacquired at 10 minutes and 24 hours after reinjection. The stress, redistribution, reinjection, and 24-hour images were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Of the 127 abnormal myocardial regions on the stress images, 55 had persistent defects on redistribution images by qualitative analysis, of which 25 (45%) demonstrated improved thallium uptake after reinjection. At the 24-hour study, 23 of the 25 regions (92%) with previously improved thallium uptake by reinjection showed no further improvement. Similarly, of the 30 regions determined to have irreversible defects after reinjection, 29 (97%) remained irreversible on 24-hour images. These findings were confirmed by the quantitative analysis. The mean normalized thallium activity in regions with enhanced thallium activity after reinjection increased from 57 +/- 13% on redistribution studies to 70 +/- 14% after reinjection but did not change at 24 hours (71 +/- 14%). In regions with irreversible defects that were unaltered by reinjection, mean regional thallium activity did not differ from the reinjection to the 24-hour studies (57 +/- 17% and 58 +/- 17%, respectively). Twenty-four-hour imaging after reinjection showed improvement in only four of 35 irreversible regions (involving three of the 50 patients). CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that thallium reinjection at rest after 3-4 hours of redistribution provides most of the clinically relevant information pertaining to myocardial viability in regions with apparently irreversible thallium defects. Hence, thallium reinjection may be used instead of 24-hour imaging in most patients in whom a persistent thallium defect is observed on conventional redistribution images. ',\n",

An outbreak of a chronic diarrheal syndrome was detected between May and August 1987 in rural Henderson County, Illinois. Seventy-two individuals were affected. Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak. Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation. Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40). Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism. Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content. Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal. Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea. Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients. Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles. After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea. One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years. We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis. This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea. ',\n",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient activities, professional staff activities, backrest position, and diurnal variations as factors that may contribute to the onset of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). The activities surrounding the recognition of first-onset SVT, as well as preoperative and postoperative data and patient characteristics were examined in 249 patients having CABG. One hundred seventy-three patients qualified for the study; 28% of these patients (n = 49) had SVT. No statistical difference was found between the subjects with SVT and those without SVT when sex, cross-clamp time, creatine kinase peak, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and number of bypasses were examined. Patients who had SVT were older than those who did not: 64.8 years for the SVT group versus 60.7 years for the non-SVT group (p less than 0.01). SVT was rare in the first 24 hours after surgery, whereas 60% of the cases occurred during the next 48 hours, without significant diurnal variation: mean time of onset was 11:50 AM.

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1982 to 1990) and bibliographic reviews of textbooks and review articles. STUDY SELECTION: In addition to several reviews, studies that evaluated the diagnostic technology of pulmonary embolism were selected. Preference was given to studies with a prospective design, particularly those done within the past decade. DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were assessed independently by three unblinded observers. Data were chosen to describe the efficacy of diagnostic technology on the basis of disease prevalence, sensitivity and specificity, and predictive value. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: A normal lung scan or pulmonary angiogram rules out the diagnosis of clinically important pulmonary embolism with at least 95% certainty. Lung scan interpretations indicating high or low probability have approximately a 15% error in diagnosing or ruling out pulmonary embolism. The accuracy of either scan result improves when the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism matches the lung scan result. Serial impedance plethysmography of the lower extremities may exclude thromboembolism with 95% certainty in patients without high-probability lung scan results or cardiopulmonary disease. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of clinical suspicion and the results of the lung scan and impedance plethysmography appear to offer acceptable diagnostic accuracy in evaluating many patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism. The usefulness of this approach for patients with cardiopulmonary disease is still unknown. ',\n",

We report a case of a patient who attained toxic carbamazepine serum concentrations (ranging from 18.2 to 21.5 micrograms/mL) two days after cardiothoracic surgery and an intraoperative myocardial infarction, and experienced lethargy, diplopia, dysarthria, diaphoresis, and horizontal and downgaze nystagmus. These alterations in serum carbamazepine concentration normalized ten days after surgery. They may have been due to a combination of changes in protein binding and decreased elimination due to altered intrinsic hepatic clearance.

The influence of 45 variables on risk of postoperative supraventricular tachycardia was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis of data from 800 consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass during a 6-year interval. Postoperative supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in 186 patients (23%) but did not contribute to any of the six early deaths (30-day mortality rate, 0.8%). Mean (+/- standard deviation) length of hospital stay was longer (9.8 +/- 5.7 versus 8.3 +/- 3.5 days; p less than 0.0001) and mean age was older (65 versus 60 years; p less than 0.002) in patients with postoperative supraventricular tachycardia than in those with regular rhythm. Risk of supraventricular tachycardia was increased in patients with a history of atrial arrhythmias (45% versus 22%; p less than 0.002) or premature atrial contractions on the preoperative electrocardiogram (48% versus 22%; p less than 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified age 65 years or more, history of atrial arrhythmia or preoperative premature atrial contractions, and preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more as independent predictors of postoperative supraventricular tachycardia. Six percent of patients converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously; 82% of patients converted within 1.1 +/- 1.9 days after onset of supraventricular tachycardia on treatment with digoxin or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or both. Only 10% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia required electrical cardioversion. We conclude that the risk of supraventricular tachycardia after coronary artery bypass is influenced by patient-related variables and is effectively managed by conventional therapy. Prophylactic treatment should be reserved for elderly patients, especially those who have atrial arrhythmias or have preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mm Hg or more. ',\n",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m-labeled hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) for the outcome after temporal lobectomy in patients with complex partial seizures. Out of 40 patients, 21 underwent right-sided and 19 left-sided temporal lobectomy. EEG and CT/MRI were primarily used to select the side of surgery. SPECT results correlated with temporal lobectomy in 68% of the patients. After surgical intervention, memory function was tested for both sides. Following left-sided temporal lobectomy, verbal memory was impaired in 8% of the patients, if SPECT agreed with the side selected for surgery, but in 83%, if it diverged from it. In the present study, there was no relationship between SPECT concordance with the side of temporal lobectomy and outcome as to seizure frequency and non-verbal memory. We conclude that preoperative interictal HMPAO/SPECT can contribute to the prediction of postoperative verbal memory function and that this method should be considered for use prior to temporal lobectomy.

There are basic principles and techniques of measurement that are relevant across biomedical disciplines. The purpose of this article is to explain some of the most important of these for medical rehabilitation, to illustrate how to use them to choose assessment instruments and to describe the nature of measurement in medical rehabilitation by examples in brain injury rehabilitation. Reliability is basic to any scientific measure. Validity, the ultimate criterion, is closely associated with the purpose of the measure. Content validity, criterion validity and construct validity are explained. Sensitivity to rehabilitative interventions and significance in patients' real lives (ecological validity) are emphasized. Measures of functional outcomes (disability) may show improvement after rehabilitation even when impairment measures do not. An extensive but selected list of measures of coma, global status, disabilities, communicative and cognitive impairments, and handicaps is presented, and their main uses are illustrated. Examples illustrate how to choose measures to study comprehensive program-level outcomes, to study learning-based interventions and to develop a general purpose database. Although there are many measures of activities of daily living and mobility, little published evidence of reliability and validity could be found even for some well-known scales. Ecologically valid and sensitive outcome measures are especially needed. Studies of the clinical utility of measures were also scarce. Many of these gaps can be spanned by clinical researchers with limited resources. Physical medicine and rehabilitation will benefit from formal studies of the reliabilities and validities of both its old and its new measurement instruments and by increased sophistication in choice of measures. \",\n",

Rates of restenosis were evaluated in 70 patients (74 lesions) after successful directional coronary atherectomy. The extent of vascular tissue resection was correlated with restenosis rates for coronary (n = 59) and vein bypass graft (n = 15) lesions. After 6 months, the overall restenosis rate was 50% (37 of 74 lesions); it was 42% (15 of 36 lesions) when intima alone was resected, 50% (7 of 14 lesions) when media was resected and 63% (15 of 24 lesions) when adventitia was resected. Subintimal tissue resection increased the restenosis rate for vein grafts (43% with intimal resection versus 100% with subintimal resection, p = 0.01) but not for coronary arteries (50% versus 48%). There was no overall difference in restenosis rates after atherectomy between primary lesions and restenosis lesions that occurred after balloon angioplasty (46% versus 54%). Among postballoon angioplasty restenosis lesions, a higher rate of restenosis after atherectomy was found with subintimal than with intimal resection (78% versus 32%, p = 0.01). Tissues from patients undergoing a second atherectomy for restenosis after initial atherectomy (n = 8) demonstrated neointimal hyperplasia that appeared histologically identical to restenotic tissue developing after balloon angioplasty (n = 37). These data suggest that the cellular response to directional coronary atherectomy is characterized by neointimal proliferation similar to that which may develop after balloon angioplasty. The extent of fibrous hyperplasia appears to be related to the depth of tissue resection in vein graft lesions and coronary artery restenosis lesions that occur after balloon angioplasty but not in primary atheromatous coronary artery lesions.

The success of surgery for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is evaluated by a variety of methods in different hospitals. Unfortunately, the predictive values of these methods are not known. We therefore compared the various methods in 261 patients undergoing surgery for SVT at Westmead Hospital since 1981. Surgical outcome was assessed by early tests during the first week after surgery (serial 12-lead electrocardiograms, telemetric monitoring of the electrocardiogram, and electrophysiological study performed using epicardial wires); later tests at 6 months after surgery (12-lead electrocardiograms and electrophysiological study); and symptomatic review done by telephone interview at a median of 34 months after surgery. Early tests were obtained in 97%, later tests were obtained in 76%, and symptomatic review was obtained in 98% of patients. All of the examined tests were inaccurate methods of surgical assessment compared with the late electrophysiological study. A large proportion of the patients proven to be surgical failures at the late electrophysiological study were not detected by early tests (83%), by later electrocardiograms (66%), or by symptomatic assessment (41%). Accurate assessment of surgical outcome requires a late electrophysiological study to permit comparison of surgical techniques. Late electrophysiological study also provides accurate information on the current risks and benefits of proposed surgery for communication to patients to enable them to make an informed decision on future treatment. Most patients are willing to have a late electrophysiological study and usually benefit from clarification of their true surgical outcome. ',\n",

We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1).

Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection. \",\n",

The radioligand used was [3H]glipizide (9 Ci/mmol). The beta-cell plasma membranes were derived from a transplantable rat insulinoma generated by subcutaneous injection of RINm5F cells and purified by ultracentrifugation on a 15-55% sucrose gradient. Specific binding of [3H]glipizide to purified beta-cell plasma membranes was determined to be maximal at temperatures of 4-23 degrees C, pH 7.3, and an incubation of 2 h. Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with Kd = 7 nM and sulfonylurea binding of 0.93 pmol/mg membrane protein. Displacement of [3H]glipizide from the purified beta-cell plasma membranes by various sulfonylureas and their analogues correlated well with their known hypoglycemic and insulin-releasing activities. Various agents, including nutrients, agents affecting Ca2+ flux, gastrointestinal hormones, and pancreatic hormones, had no effect on [3H]glipizide binding to the beta-cell plasma membranes. Putative sulfonylurea receptors on beta-cell and brain cell plasma membranes have been reported by several groups of investigators. Sulfonylurea binding to the beta-cell is hypothesized to close an ATP-sensitive K+ channel, which leads to depolarization of the membrane and activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. ',\n",

Forty patients with widely disseminated or locally advanced malignant obstruction of the middle or lower third of the oesophagus underwent endoscopic treatment by either NdYAG laser recanalization or intubation. Groups were matched on the basis of tumour location and swallowing was graded clinically before and after treatment. Technical success was achieved in 17 of 20 laser treated and 18 of 20 intubated patients. Pretreatment swallowing ability, histology, tumour location and overall length were unrelated to functional outcome in both groups. However, circumferential tumour length identified endoscopically strongly influenced the quality of swallowing after laser recanalization. Patients with excellent swallowing quality (n = 7) had significantly shorter circumferential tumour lengths, 3.1(1.0) cm, than those with poorer quality swallowing (n = 10), 6.3(1.6)cm, (P less than 0.001). Both methods of treatment had low complication rates and there was one death in the series in the laser-treated group. Laser recanalization provides a better functional result than intubation for short (less than 4 cm) circumferential tumour. Intubation at a single session seems more appropriate than repeated laser therapy when tumour length exceeds 4 cm. ',\n",

Previous studies have demonstrated that adenosine significantly enhances myocardial salvage after 90 minutes of regional ischemia. To determine its effect after prolonged ischemia, closed-chest dogs underwent 3 hours of left anterior descending artery occlusion followed by 72 hours of reperfusion. Intracoronary adenosine (3.75 mg/min; at 1.5 ml/min:total volume = 90 ml; n = 10) or an equivalent volume of saline (1.5 ml/min: total volume = 90 ml; n = 9) was infused into the left main coronary artery during the first 60 minutes of reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow was assessed serially with microspheres and regional ventricular function was assessed by contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was determined histologically. Light and electron microscopy were utilized to assess neutrophil infiltration and microvascular injury. Adenosine failed to reduce infarct size expressed as a percentage of the area at risk (38.0 +/- 4.9% versus 34.8 +/- 4.6%; p = NS) or to improve regional ventricular function as measured by the radial shortening method (3.2 +/- 1.8% versus 2.2 +/- 3.1%; p = NS) at 72 hours after reperfusion. Vasodilatory effects were not observed in the endo- and midmyocardial regions of the ischemic zone during adenosine administration. This was associated with a similar extent of capillary endothelial changes and neutrophil infiltration in both adenosine-treated and saline control groups. These results suggest that severe functional abnormalities are present in the vasculature after 3 hours of ischemia and that adenosine therapy is ineffective in enhancing myocardial salvage. ',\n",

The relation between coronary heart disease and disability was examined in 2,576 community-dwelling women and men ages 55-88 years. These Framingham Study participants were originally recruited in 1948-51 for an examination of cardiovascular disease. Twenty-seven years later, remaining members of the cohort were interviewed to ascertain physical abilities, and a score on a disability scale was assigned. Multivariate logistic analyses examined disability in relation to uncomplicated angina pectoris (AP), complicated AP, and coronary heart disease other than AP, controlling for possible confounders. In younger and older women and men, uncomplicated and complicated AP were associated with disability. Coronary heart disease other than AP was associated with disability only in the younger men. Congestive heart failure predicted disability only in the women. These results suggest that onset of AP should be recognized as a critical point in the development of disability and that AP is a better predictor of disability than is myocardial infarction or coronary insufficiency.

Either urokinase (4,400 U/kg bolus followed by 4,400 U/kg/h) or streptokinase (250,000 U bolus followed by 100,000 U/h) was used, and venograms were performed before and after. Overall, 56 percent of patients had complete clot lysis and relief of symptoms. Thrombolytic therapy was effective in eight (73 percent) of 11 patients receiving urokinase and one (20 percent) of five patients receiving streptokinase.

We measured regional cerebral blood flow using the xenon-133 inhalation method, at approximately 1 month after onset, in 60 stroke patients who had no evidence of major carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. Their single lesions (43 infarcts and 17 hematomas) were located in the capsulothalamolenticular region, sparing the cortex. Hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow was reduced on the side of the lesion in 25 patients and on both sides in 20. Regional hypoperfusion was observed in 46 patients (ipsilaterally in 34, bilaterally in 10, and contralaterally in two). Regional hypoperfusion was observed most frequently in the frontal lobe, particularly in the motor and premotor cortices of the prerolandic area. The 46 patients with regional hypoperfusion were compared with the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion, considering the size and location of the lesion as well as the functional and analytic motor performances. As a rule, the lesion was slightly smaller and more posterior and the functional (p less than 0.001) and analytic (p less than 0.05) motor performances were significantly better in the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion. Since the xenon-133 inhalation method examines cortical blood flow, we can attribute blood flow reductions resulting from deep-seated lesions to a functional depression akin to diaschisis. Interpretation of the clinical consequences and pathogenesis of this phenomenon requires further sequential and pathologic studies. ',\n",

Forty-two patients were evaluated for nonsustained VT. Eighty patients were evaluated for sustained VT: 30 of these had spontaneous sustained VT only while receiving empiric therapy with quinidine or procainamide, whereas the remaining 50 developed spontaneous VT in the absence of antiarrhythmic drugs.

Right atrial appendage magnesium concentration correlated positively with serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.31, p = 0.002) and negatively with serum calcium concentration (r = -0.29, p = 0.013).

Mitral valve areas before and after balloon mitral valvuloplasty were serially determined by the Doppler continuity equation method in 16 patients. Ultrasound examinations were performed before and immediately after balloon inflation and 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area determined by the Doppler continuity equation method correlated well with that determined at catheterization by the Gorlin formula, not only before but also immediately after balloon inflation (y = 0.87 x + 0.05, standard error of estimate = 0.22 cm2, r = 0.90). Serial calculation of mitral valve area by the Doppler continuity equation method showed a slight but significant decrease in the valve area at 24 hours after balloon mitral valvuloplasty but no change after that. We conclude that the Doppler continuity equation method provides an accurate estimation of mitral valve area before and even after balloon valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area dilated by balloon inflation is decreased slightly within 24 hours after the procedure, which corroborates valve stretch as one mechanism for increasing mitral valve area with balloon valvuloplasty. Estimation of mitral valve area immediately after balloon mitral valvuloplasty may overestimate the long-term efficacy of the procedure. ',\n",

All the patients with STP and two of those with ITN had trigeminal reflex abnormalities; 80% of patients with STP and 30% of those with ITN had evoked potential abnormalities.

The effect of volume expansion of extracellular fluid on gastroduodenal resistance to the flow of isotonic saline was assessed in three groups of rats using intravenous infusions of isotonic, isotonic-isoncotic, and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions. The gastroduodenal segment of 29 male Wistar rats was barostatically perfused at a constant pressure gradient of 4 cm H2O and changes in flow (ml/minute) were taken as a reflection of changes in gastroduodenal resistance. Isotonic expansion led to a 33% drop in gastroduodenal flow compared with the normovolaemic period in the same animals (p less than 0.01). Extracellular fluid expansion with isotonic-isoncotic and isotonic-isoncotic-isohaemic solutions was associated with reductions in gastroduodenal flow of 29% (p less than 0.05) and 31% (p less than 0.01) respectively. The increase in gastroduodenal resistance is due to hypervolaemia per se and not to haemodilution, decreases in plasma oncotic pressure, or electrolyte imbalance. The effect of hypervolaemia on gastroduodenal resistance, which was reversed by small haemorrhages (0.5-1.0 ml per 100 g body weight), may be due to changes in tonus or phasic motor activity, or both, and may be part of the homeostatic processes that help the organism minimise liquid volume excess.

       " '321': 'Progress and challenges in psychosocial and behavioral research in cancer in the twentieth century. Research in the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of cancer has shown steady growth since the 1950s, and its course of development has paralleled the history of medical techniques in treating cancer. Table 1 outlines this parallel evolution from the 1850s to the 1960s. The roles of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in spearheading and nurturing research in this area are documented. Interest in psychooncologic questions can be traced back for centuries to the search for etiologic factors and psychologic variables that would explain individual vulnerability to cancer. The first psychologic studies of cancer patients were reported in 1951 and 1952 from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, respectively. The 1970s saw new interest in psychosocial and behavioral research with many issues being addressed for the first time: better care of the terminally ill through more humanistic approaches including better means of pain control; ethical concerns related to patient rights and their status as subjects in experimental protocols; trying to measure quality of life for cancer patients on protocols; seeing the need for multidisciplinary collaborative groups to make up for the absence of formal training in this area; and the need to design valid, accurate measuring scales specific to the symptomology of patients with cancer. Table 4 outlines how the 1980s gave increasing recognition and support to the psychosocial dimensions of cancer. This period produced a series of key conferences that examined a broad research and education perspective and produced recommendations that remain a benchmark in regard to instrumentation, conceptual models, pitfalls of psychosocial research, training, and education, and the organization of research efforts. New precision has been added to the field in the past 6 years: studies measuring concurrent psychologic, endocrine, and immune function; use of statistical modeling to incorporate quality of life data as a correction factor in survival data (TWiST and QALY); and broadened definitions of medical outcome to include functional status, thus allowing advances in psychiatric measurements to help answer questions in cancer. The challenges for the 1990s are identified in a summary in Table 9. Especially noteworthy is the observation that the comprehensive research needed today cannot be carried out by any one discipline alone. New approaches call for areas of the social sciences formerly inactive in cancer research (e.g., anthropology) to contribute the tools and expertise required to address the problems. ',\n",

Spastic preparations showed hind-limb spasticity and reflex incontinence one to two days after operation. Hypertrophic fibers began to appear in spastic muscles after two weeks. This hypertrophy, thought to be caused by phasic repetitive contraction, was verified by electron microscopy to be different from normal exercise hypertrophy. Flaccid preparations maintained hind-limb flaccidity and overflow incontinence. In flaccid muscle, marked muscle fiber necrosis indicated rapid atrophy.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical usefulness of renography performed in combination with captopril administration (\"captopril renography\") in diagnosing renal artery stenosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with suspected renal artery stenosis underwent renography prior to performance of renal angiography. Renography was performed on two consecutive days using technetium-99m-diethylenetiamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) as an index of glomerular filtration rate and iodine-131-orthoiodohippurate (OIH) as an index of renal blood flow. Captopril (25 mg orally, crushed) was administered 1 hour before the second study. Renal artery stenosis was defined as a stenosis exceeding 70%. Renographic criteria were then established, retrospectively, to differentiate renal artery stenosis from essential hypertension based on (1) asymmetry of function and (2) the presence of captopril-induced changes. RESULTS: Renal artery stenosis was detected in 35 of 55 patients (21 with unilateral and 14 with bilateral stenosis). Three criteria were established for diagnosing renal artery stenosis: (1) a percent uptake of DTPA by the affected kidney of less than 40% of the combined bilateral uptake, (2) a delayed time to peak uptake of DTPA, which was more than 5 minutes longer in the affected kidney than in the contralateral kidney, (3) a delayed excretion of DTPA, with retention at 15 minutes, as a fraction of peak activity, more than 20% greater than in the contralateral kidney. The presence of one or more of these criteria was diagnostic of renal artery stenosis, with a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 75%, respectively before captopril administration, and 94% and 95% after captopril administration. Lesser degrees of asymmetry (i.e., uptake of 40% to 50%) had very poor diagnostic specificity. Among patients with bilateral stenoses, asymmetry identified the more severely affected kidney, but the presence or absence of stenosis in the contralateral kidney could not be reliably determined. When pre- and post-captopril studies were compared, the presence of captopril-induced scintigraphic changes was a highly specific finding for renal artery stenosis, but occurred in only 51% of the cases. OIH scintigraphy provided similar results, with slightly lower sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Asymmetry of DTPA uptake, time to peak uptake, or retention seen on a single post-captopril renogram is a highly sensitive and specific finding in detecting renal artery stenosis but does not distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease. If renograms are obtained both before and after captopril administration, the presence of captopril-induced change is a highly specific finding for the detection of renal artery stenosis, but the sensitivity of this finding is low.

Patients were exclusively rehydrated with one of two types of ORS during the first 24 hours of treatment. On the second day, oral feedings were started with a lactose-free formula, and ORS was given to replace stool losses. Body weight, ORS, food intake, vomitus, stool, and urine output were recorded at 6-hour intervals. Blood was drawn at the time of admission, after rehydration, and at 24 and 48 hours of hospitalization to monitor blood gases and electrolytes. Rehydration was satisfactory in both groups of patients. ORS that contained alanine did not reduce the purging rates of the infants compared with those who received standard ORS. Clinically no adverse effect of the alanine-based ORS was observed during hospitalization. None of the patients had significant hypernatremia or hyponatremia, and serum amino acid levels were not altered. These data show that the addition of 30 mmol/L alanine to the standard WHO-ORS produces no further improvement in the outcome of the infants with acute diarrhea compared with those fed the standard WHO-ORS.

Coronary thrombolysis is the treatment of choice for patients with acute Q-wave myocardial infarcts who have no contraindications to such therapy. However, the time required for thrombolysis and the possibility of reocclusion of the infarct-related artery remain problematic. Herein are described experimental animal studies and clinical evaluations in which attempts have been made to develop adjunctive therapies that, when coupled with available thrombolytic interventions, might shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent reocclusion. From the studies conducted to date, it is clear that a combined thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonist with a serotonin receptor antagonist and heparin shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models with copper coil-induced coronary artery thrombi. A monoclonal antibody to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor coupled with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and heparin also shortens the time to thrombolysis and delays or prevents reocclusion in experimental canine models. Thrombin inhibitors, including heparin and synthetic inhibitors, given with t-PA and aspirin, appear to shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion in experimental canine models. Aspirin coupled with intravenous streptokinase reduces mortality in patients with presumed acute myocardial infarction, and a combination of heparin and t-PA results in infarct-artery patency more frequently than t-PA without heparin. Data from these studies are encouraging with regard to the possibility of developing effective and relatively safe thrombolytic regimens that shorten the time to thrombolysis and delay or prevent coronary artery reocclusion.

A total of 1,975 plasma diltiazem concentrations were obtained from 1,067 patients enrolled in a multicenter secondary intervention study of diltiazem after acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the determinants and significance of diltiazem concentrations in this patient population, we related drug concentrations to a variety of clinical variables recorded on the case history forms. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that (1) time from the last drug dose, (2) drug dose taken, (3) patient height (an index of lean body weight), and (4) patient age were important determinants of plasma concentration. For an equivalent dose, plasma diltiazem concentrations in a 75-year-old patient were about double those of a 25-year-old patient. Total weight and drug dose prescribed did not significantly affect plasma concentrations. Whereas drug concentrations were higher (p = 0.01) among patients with left-sided heart failure, they were not altered by renal dysfunction, hepatic disease or beta blockers. Diltiazem concentrations were a significant determinant of diastolic arterial pressure (p less than 10(-9), but neither systolic pressure nor heart rate were significantly related to diltiazem concentration. The overall incidence of adverse experiences was not related to drug concentrations, but the occurrence of second- and third-degree atrioventricular block in the coronary care unit and the need for a temporary pacemaker were substantially higher among patients with a drug concentration greater than 150 ng/ml (7.4 and 1.9%, respectively) than among patients with lower concentrations (2.6% for atrioventricular block, 0.3% for pacemaker; p = 0.02 for each). The risk of atrioventricular block was particularly increased by high diltiazem concentrations in the face of acute inferior infarction. These results suggest that diltiazem's pharmacologic and clinical effects in a large population are concentration-related, and that the consideration of patient size, age, and left ventricular function in selecting a diltiazem dose may allow for effective drug therapy with a reduced likelihood of adverse effects. \",\n",

In contrast, treatment with SQ29548 was without effect on the blood pressure of either normotensive or hypertensive rats (i.e., aortic coarctation-induced hypertension at 90-113 days after coarctation, deoxycorticosterone-salt-induced hypertension) having normal or depressed values of plasma renin activity. The blood pressure-lowering effect of SQ29548 in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension was positively correlated with the prevailing plasma renin activity and could not be demonstrated in hypertensive rats pretreated with indomethacin. We attribute the hypotensive effect of SQ29548 to interference with pressor mechanisms that depend on activation of thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors and suggest that such prostanoid-mediated mechanisms are operational and contribute to an increase in blood pressure in angiotensin-dependent forms of hypertension. Also prostanoid-mediated vasodepressor mechanisms are operational in the early phase of aortic coarctation-induced hypertension since the blood pressure of rats pretreated with SQ29548 was increased by the subsequent administration of indomethacin. Accordingly, the blood pressure of rats with aortic coarctation-induced hypertension is influenced by the interplay of prostanoid-mediated pressor and vasodepressor mechanisms. ',\n",

The object of this study was to assess the usefulness of the dipyridamole-echocardiography test in the early evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting, when the use of an exercise stress test is precluded. We studied 39 consecutive patients (37 men and two women, mean age 57.3 years) referred to our institute for elective coronary artery bypass. Five patients had single, 12 patients double, 20 patients triple vessel disease, and two had left main stem disease. Nineteen left internal mammary artery grafts, 20 sequential grafts, and 39 single vein grafts were performed. All the patients were subjected to the test before (time range 1 to 3 days) and after (time range 6 to 10 days) the operation in the absence of therapy. Dipyridamole was administered intravenously 0.56 mg/kg over 4 minutes (low dose); if no effect was apparent, an additional 0.28 mg/kg over 2 minutes (high dose) was given. During the test, blood pressure and a twelve-lead electrocardiogram were monitored. An arbitrary wall motion score was derived by dividing the left ventricle into six regions and grading from 0 to 3-normokinetic, hypokinetic, akinetic, and dyskinetic zones. Preoperatively the test was positive in 38 patients as evidenced by wall motion abnormalities (36 patients had electrocardiographic changes) and in one patient by electrocardiographic changes and chest pain; 22 tests were positive after the low dose and 17 after the high dose. Angina was present in 33 patients. Mean wall motion score was 1.64 per patient in the basal condition and 4.03 per patient after the test (p less than 0.001). After coronary bypass in three patients the test was positive at the same dosage that was used preoperatively, as shown by wall motion abnormalities (in two patients by electrocardiographic changes, as well). Four patients had symptoms. Furthermore, at 6 months' follow-up, a treadmill stress test performed in these three patients was positive for ischemia and angina. The wall motion score was 1.25 per patient in the basal condition and 1.53 per patient after the test (no significant difference). When the preoperative wall motion score obtained after dipyridamole echocardiography was compared with the postoperative score, a statistically significant difference was seen: 4.03 per patient versus 1.53 per patient (p less than 001). In eight patients we observed an improvement of basal myocardial contractility after the operation, which indicates the reversibility of wall motion abnormalities observed before coronary bypass.

To assess the magnitude of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) occurrence among recipients of pituitary-derived human growth hormone (HGH), we conducted an epidemiologic follow-up of 6284 recipients of HGH distributed through the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Seven neuropathologically confirmed cases of CJD have occurred in this population to date: six patients with clinical CJD presented with ataxia and imbalance, rather than with altered mentation, which is the most common initial manifestation in sporadic CJD, and one patient died in the preclinical incubation state of the disease. All seven cases occurred among the nearly 700 HGH recipients who started therapy before 1970. Since only 10% of the cohort has been followed up for the 15-year average incubation interval from midpoint of HGH treatment to onset of symptoms, the great majority of potentially exposed patients have not yet attained the requisite incubation period for expression of CJD. The median duration of HGH therapy of 100 months in the CJD cases was significantly longer than 41 months for all patients starting treatment before 1970; thus, the duration of pituitary HGH therapy is a major risk factor for CJD.

       " '335': 'Regional myocardial metabolism of high-energy phosphates during isometric exercise in patients with coronary artery disease BACKGROUND. The maintenance of cellular levels of high-energy phosphates is required for myocardial function and preservation. In animals, severe myocardial ischemia is characterized by the rapid loss of phosphocreatine and a decrease in the ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP. METHODS. To determine whether ischemic metabolic changes are detectable in humans, we recorded spatially localized phosphorus-31 nuclear-magnetic-resonance (31P NMR) spectra from the anterior myocardium before, during, and after isometric hand-grip exercise. RESULTS. The mean (+/- SD) ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP in the left ventricular wall when subjects were at rest was 1.72 +/- 0.15 in normal subjects (n = 11) and 1.59 +/- 0.31 in patients with nonischemic heart disease (n = 9), and the ratio did not change during hand-grip exercise in either group. However, in patients with coronary heart disease and ischemia due to severe stenosis (greater than or equal to 70 percent) of the left anterior descending or left main coronary arteries (n = 16), the ratio decreased from 1.45 +/- 0.31 at rest to 0.91 +/- 0.24 during exercise (P less than 0.001) and recovered to 1.27 +/- 0.38 two minutes after exercise. Only three patients with coronary heart disease had clinical symptoms of ischemia during exercise. Repeat exercise testing in five patients after revascularization yielded values of 1.60 +/- 0.20 at rest and 1.62 +/- 0.18 during exercise (P not significant), as compared with 1.51 +/- 0.19 at rest and 1.02 +/- 0.26 during exercise before revascularization (P less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. The decrease in the ratio of phosphocreatine to ATP during hand-grip exercise in patients with myocardial ischemia reflects a transient imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in myocardium with compromised blood flow. Exercise testing with 31P NMR is a useful method of assessing the effect of ischemia on myocardial metabolism of high-energy phosphates and of monitoring the response to treatment. ',\n",

Invasive candidiasis is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. Few biochemically defined markers of invasive candidiasis are known. Initial findings suggested that the presence of candida enolase in the blood may be a novel marker for invasive candidiasis. METHODS. We tested 170 patients at high risk for invasive candidiasis for candida enolase antigenemia. All the patients had cancer and neutropenia. We detected antigen using a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay for candida enolase in serially collected serum samples. Invasive candidiasis was proved by finding candida species in deep nonmucosal tissue, blood cultures, or both. Antigen testing was performed with the investigator blinded to tissue or culture diagnosis. RESULTS. Among 24 patients with proved invasive candidiasis, 149 serum samples were tested for enolase antigenemia; 80 were positive and 69 negative (sensitivity per sample, 54 percent). Multiple sampling improved the detection of antigenemia, which was found in 11 of 13 proved cases of deep tissue infection (85 percent) and in 7 of 11 proved cases of fungemia (64 percent). Specificity was 96 percent as measured against control groups including patients with mucosal colonization, bacteremia, and other deep mycoses. Antigenemia was detected in the absence of fungemia in 5 cases of deep tissue candidiasis, but was not detected in 6 cases of fungemia alone. CONCLUSIONS. Candida enolase antigenemia is a novel marker for invasive candidiasis. It may be a useful indicator of deep infection in patients with cancer and neutropenia and may complement the diagnostic usefulness of blood cultures. ',\n",

A single immunization of Lewis rats with purified acetylcholine receptor (AChR) emulsified in adjuvant typically stimulates the production of oligoclonal AChR-reactive antibodies (as demonstrated by IEF) dominated by the IgG2a subclass, of moderate but clonotypically heterogeneous relative Ag-binding avidity, and capable of inducing symptoms of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Although similar immunization of Wistar Furth rats produces AChR-reactive antibodies with similar characteristics of clonotypic heterogeneity, avidity, and isotype expression, no detectable signs of AChR-dependent muscle impairment is observed. This contrasts the ability to induce impaired AChR function upon the passive transfer of pre-formed Lewis anti-AChR antibodies into naive Wistar Furth rats, suggesting that disease resistance in this model is not conferred at the level of the AChR itself. Moreover, if more aggressive immunization protocols are used (i.e., multiple injections of AChR), a transient breakthrough of AChR-dependent muscle dysfunction can be induced directly in the Wistar Furth strain indicating that the potential for the production of disease-causing antibodies does exist in the Wistar Furth repertoire. IEF analysis of Wistar Furth anti-AChR antibodies has revealed that hyperimmunization results in modified antibody clonotype expression that might explain changing expression of disease symptoms; however, explanations for the apparent \"resistance\" of Wistar Furth rats to disease induction are likely to be complex.

Although sinus bradycardia and low heart rate with exercise have been found in some patients with long QT syndrome, systematic evaluation, including intracardiac electrophysiologic (EPS) tests of sinus node function, has not been reported. Records were reviewed of 14 children and adolescents (age 3 to 16 years) with long QT syndrome (mean QTc 0.51 second) who underwent noninvasive testing and intracardiac EPS because of syncope or cardiac arrest. The resting electrocardiographic (ECG) sinus heart rate was low for age in only 1 of 13 patients, while the lowest Holter-monitored sinus heart rate was abnormal in 4 of 12. The maximum exercise heart rate was abnormally low in 6 of the 12 who underwent exercise testing. For the EPS tests, the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) was long in 8 of 14 and the sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) was long in six of the nine in whom it was calculable. When both noninvasive and EPS indices are considered, 13 of the 14 patients had some type of sinus node dysfunction. ',\n",

We examined the effects of the following variables on interpleural analgesia after thoracotomy: addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic, thoracostomy drainage, two-catheter placement, and location of catheter tips. Twenty patients were randomized to have one catheter (paravertebral tip location) or two catheters (paravertebral and lateral thoracic wall tip locations). Interpleural catheters were sutured to the parietal pleura by the surgeon at time of wound closure. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine through the single catheter or 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with or without 1:200,000 epinephrine through each of the two catheters while supine. Bupivacaine concentrations in whole blood and in thoracostomy drainage fluid were assayed by gas chromatography. Actual content of bupivacaine in the drainage fluid was calculated. Degree of analgesia was assessed by verbal numerical pain scores over the first 4 h and opioid demand thereafter. Addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine did not influence the degree of analgesia. Approximately 30%-40% of any administered dose of bupivacaine was lost via the thoracostomy tube over a 4-h period. There was no correlation between the true initial dose (100 mg minus thoracostomy drainage) and Cmax. Use of two catheters resulted in significantly less opioid requirements after an initial 8-h period. Failure to achieve adequate interpleural analgesia in postthoracotomy patients may be related to loss of anesthetic via thoracostomy drainage, presence of extravasated blood and tissue fluid in the pleural space, and possibly sequestration and channeling of flow of local anesthetic by restricted motion of an operated lung.

In an attempt to define this tumor's characteristics and response to therapy, all cases of chondrosarcoma treated at the University of Michigan over the past 25 years were retrospectively studied. Fourteen cases originating in the nose and paranasal sinuses, mandible, temporal bone, and larynx were reviewed. Aggressive surgical resection was the mainstay of treatment, and resulted in an overall survival of 70%, with an average follow-up of 3.5 years. Survival was highest in primary temporal bone lesions, and lowest in paranasal sinus lesions. Unresectable lesions were not cured by other modalities. This study, therefore, continued to support the crucial role of wide surgical resection in the treatment of head and neck chondrosarcoma, but conservative resection, when needed to preserve important structures, has resulted in long-term survival. \",\n",

Since Helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa in most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer, infection with this organism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this common disease. We postulated that if H. pylori is pathogenic in the usual type of duodenal ulcer, it should be less common when duodenal ulcer has another, specific etiology, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastric mucosa was compared from 18 patients with proven Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (17 of whom had had duodenal ulcer disease) and 18 controls with chronic duodenal ulcer without such a diagnosis. All subjects, who were matched for age and sex, had undergone elective gastric resections. Gastric tissues were stained by hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa and were reviewed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the diagnosis. The frequency of H. pylori in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (8/18) was lower than in controls with duodenal ulcer (16/18; P less than 0.02). Moreover, chronic antral gastritis scores were higher in patients with duodenal ulcer (P less than 0.01). In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, peak acid output was lower in patients positive (median 22 meq/30 min) compared to those negative for H. pylori (median 32 meq/30 min; P less than 0.02) but serum gastrin was correspondingly lower in patients positive for H. pylori (P less than 0.05). H. pylori infection appears to be more frequent when duodenal ulceration is not associated with another etiology, such as acid hypersecretion in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may also be associated with decreased gastric acid secretion. ',\n",

We have isolated a 1.1-kilobase cDNA clone that encodes human fibrillarin by screening a hepatoma library in parallel with DNA probes derived from the fibrillarin genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NOP1) and Xenopus laevis. RNA blot analysis indicates that the corresponding mRNA is approximately 1300 nucleotides in length. Human fibrillarin expressed in vitro migrates on SDS gels as a 36-kDa protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by antisera from humans with scleroderma autoimmune disease. Human fibrillarin contains an amino-terminal repetitive domain approximately 75-80 amino acids in length that is rich in glycine and arginine residues and is similar to amino-terminal domains in the yeast and Xenopus fibrillarins. The occurrence of a putative RNA-binding domain and an RNP consensus sequence within the protein is consistent with the association of fibrillarin with small nucleolar RNAs. Protein sequence alignments show that 67% of amino acids from human fibrillarin are identical to those in yeast fibrillarin and that 81% are identical to those in Xenopus fibrillarin. This identity suggests the evolutionary conservation of an important function early in the pathway for ribosome biosynthesis. ',\n",

Intraoperative evaluations were compared with histologic findings. In 85 cases not diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, malignancy was confirmed in 97.6 percent of cases and histologic type in 71.8 percent. In the 28 cases diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, there was only one false-negative. The most important finding during thoracotomy is whether a lesion is malignant or not. The time required to obtain a pathologic diagnosis also is important. We are able to obtain the results of a cytologic diagnosis within 10 min.

The diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. The 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). All patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. Only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. At the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. On the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. Multivariate analysis (by Cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. The identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer. ',\n",

Gated pool scintigraphy confirmed normal LV systolic function but demonstrated severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Catheterization revealed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as the cause of right-sided failure.

Functional limitations included depending on others for transportation (33%) and mental incompetence or poor recent memory (42%). The percentage of patients with functional limitation increased sharply with increasing age. In a substantial number of patients there was also evidence for poor social support networks; 26.5% of subjects lived alone and 38.9% had no children living in the vicinity. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the predictors of having a poor social support network included non-Hispanic white ethnicity, advanced age, low income, and being a recent migrant to the area. Subjects with functional limitations were more likely to have poor social support networks than subjects without such limitations. The deleterious combination of impaired functional status and a limited social support network may explain why elderly cancer patients are at increased risk for not receiving appropriate therapy. Given the potential complexities involving the evaluation and appropriate treatment of cancer, care must be taken to adequately assess functional status and support mechanisms of older patients, and to provide adequate support to ensure compliance with treatment.

The effect of PC (three cycles of 2 minutes of coronary occlusion and 5 minutes of reperfusion) on development of arrhythmias after a subsequent 5-minute coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion was studied. Rats (n = 16 each group) underwent 5-minute occlusion and reperfusion alone or preceded by PC; arrhythmias were monitored during ischemia and for 10 minutes of reperfusion, and biopsies were taken for creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate in ischemic and nonischemic zones of the left ventricle. PC reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) during occlusion (81% control versus 13% PC, p less than 0.001). On subsequent reperfusion, ventricular fibrillation (VF) developed in zero PC animals versus 13 (81%) of controls (p less than 0.001), and irreversible VF in zero of PC versus seven (44%) of controls (p = 0.007).

Supramaximal single- and multiple-pulse stimulation of the common peroneal nerve produced stable torque responses of the dorsiflexor muscles (monitored in vivo), which dantrolene suppressed. With the multiple-pulse stimulation (5-6 pulses) this torque suppression was significantly less in MH-susceptible subjects than in control subjects. This distinction, also observed in MH swine, confirms this animal as a good model for human MH. That dantrolene's effect in MH can be more completely reversed with high frequency stimulation is intriguing; presumably, excitation-contraction coupling differs in MH and normal muscle. \",\n",

This study 1) compares the negative chronotropic and dromotropic actions of adenosine in guinea pig, rat, and rabbit hearts; 2) investigates the mechanism(s) for the different responses; and 3) determines the physiological implications. Isolated perfused hearts were instrumented for measurement of atrial rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time. Differences in metabolism of adenosine were determined in the absence and presence of dipyridamole (nucleoside uptake blocker) and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, adenosine deaminase inhibitor). Dipyridamole plus EHNA decreased adenosine's EC50 for the negative dromotropic effect by 14-fold in guinea pig heart and 1.6-fold in rat heart. This is consistent with the greater number of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding sites measured in membranes from guinea pig (1,231 +/- 68 fmol/mg protein) compared with rat (302 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein) and rabbit (260 +/- 28 fmol/mg protein) atria. The potency of adenosine to slow atrial rate and prolong AV nodal conduction time was greater in guinea pig than in rat or rabbit hearts. This rank order of potency correlated well with the number of binding sites for the specific adenosine receptor radioligand 125I-aminobenzyladenosine in guinea pig (102 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein), rat (11 +/- 0.5 fmol/mg protein), and rabbit (8 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein) atrial membranes. Hypoxia increased the rate of adenosine release by severalfold and caused slowing of heart rate and AV block. In spontaneously beating hearts, the main effect of hypoxia was a slowing of ventricular rate, which in the guinea pig heart was due to AV block and in the rat heart to atrial slowing. In atrial paced hearts, hypoxia caused a marked prolongation of AV nodal conduction time in guinea pig (39 +/- 4 msec) and rabbit (29 +/- 5 msec) hearts, but only small effect in rat hearts (10 +/- 2 msec). The differences in response to hypoxia could be accounted for by the species-dependent differences in the 1) amount of adenosine released and metabolized, 2) sensitivity of the hearts to adenosine, and 3) dependency of AV nodal conduction on atrial rate. The findings indicate that the results from physiological or pharmacological studies on adenosine in one species may not be applicable to others, and the ultimate effect of adenosine and hypoxia is to slow ventricular rate. \",\n",

The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect.

Two hundred and ninety-eight critically ill patients at risk for the development of postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding were randomized into three groups. The first group comprised 85 patients who received meciadanol, a new bioflavonoid, 500 milligrams every six hours through a nasograstric tube; the second group comprised 100 patients who received sucralfate (crushed tablets), 1,000 milligrams every six hours through a nasogastric tube, and the third group comprised 113 patients who received an antacid (Maalox [magnesium aluminum hydroxide gel]) through a nasogastric tube at an initial dose of 15 milliliters every hour. The gastric pH was measured hourly and titrated to a pH greater than or equal to 4.0 in patients in the group receiving the antacid. The gastric pH was measured every two hours in the other two groups. Bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract was determined visually (frank blood in gastric contents) or by guaiac testing. Bleeding occurred in seven patients receiving meciadanol, nine receiving sucralfate and six receiving the antacid. The difference in rates of bleeding was not statistically significant. Correlation between the severity of illness index and the development of bleeding was poor, at least in the low and intermediate index range. In contrast, there was a strong correlation between the age of the patient and the development of bleeding. Only one patient younger than 50 years had bleeding develop. Apparently, meciadanol exerts its action by a mechanism other than pH control. It may, therefore, fill an important gap in the ability to prevent postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding. ',\n",

To estimate the incidence of residual atrial septal perforation (ASP) following percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) with the Inoue balloon catheter and to examine the factors contributing to ASP, we studied 46 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing PTMC. Residual ASP was evaluated by Doppler color flow imaging 1 day after PTMC, and was detected in 7 out of 46 patients (15.2%). We examined the relationship between the development of ASP (ASP+) and the age of the patient, the left atrial dimension before PTMC, the mean pressure difference between left and right atrium after PTMC, and the duration of the procedure from atrial septal puncture by the Brockenbrough method to balloon inflation. There was a good correlation between the development of residual ASP and the duration of the procedure (ASP+, 51.0 +/- 34.0 minutes; without ASP, 24.6 +/- 16.2 minutes; p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant correlation between the development of ASP and other factors. In the follow-up study, ASP disappeared in four patients within 3 months. ASP persisted in two patients for 1 year after PTMC. However, the shunt in these two patients was clinically insignificant. These data suggest that residual ASP may depend on the duration of the procedure, and that most cases of ASP disappear within 1 year after PTMC. ',\n",
       " '368': 'Childhood traumas: an outline and overview Childhood psychic trauma appears to be a crucial etiological factor in the development of a number of serious disorders both in childhood and in adulthood. Like childhood rheumatic fever, psychic trauma sets a number of different problems into motion, any of which may lead to a definable mental condition. The author suggests four characteristics related to childhood trauma that appear to last for long periods of life, no matter what diagnosis the patient eventually receives. These are visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories of the traumatic event, repetitive behaviors, trauma-specific fears, and changed attitudes about people, life, and the future. She divides childhood trauma into two basic types and defines the findings that can be used to characterize each of these types. Type I trauma includes full, detailed memories, \"omens,\" and misperceptions. Type II trauma includes denial and numbing, self-hypnosis and dissociation, and rage. Crossover conditions often occur after sudden, shocking deaths or accidents that leave children handicapped. In these instances, characteristics of both type I and type II childhood traumas exist side by side. There may be considerable sadness. Each finding of childhood trauma discussed by the author is illustrated with one or two case examples. ',\n",
       " '369': 'Outcome of CPR in a large metropolitan area--where are the survivors? STUDY OBJECTIVES: Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in cities with populations of more than 1 million has not been studied adequately. This study was undertaken to determine the overall survival rate for Chicago and the effect of previously reported variables on survival, and to compare the observed survival rates with those previously reported. DESIGN: Consecutive prehospital arrest patients were studied prospectively during 1987. SETTING: The study area was the city of Chicago, which has more than 3 million inhabitants in 228 square miles. The emergency medical services system, with 55 around-the-clock ambulances and 550 paramedics, is single-tiered and responds to more than 200,000 emergencies per year. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: We studied 3,221 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest on whom paramedics attempted resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of patients were pronounced dead in emergency departments, 7% died in hospitals, and 2% survived to hospital discharge. Survival was significantly greater with bystander-witnessed arrest, bystander-initiated CPR, paramedic-witnessed arrest, initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, and shorter treatment intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival rates were significantly lower than those reported in most previous studies, all based on smaller communities; they were consistent with the rates reported in the one comparable study of a large city. The single factor that most likely contributed to the poor overall survival was the relatively long interval between collapse and defibrillation. Logistical, demographic, and other special characteristics of large cities may have affected the rates. To improve treatment of cardiac arrest in large cities and maximize the use of community resources, we recommend further study of comparable metropolitan areas using standardized terms and methodology. Detailed analysis of each component of the emergency medical services systems will aid in making improvements to maximize survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ',\n",

Of 153 patients presenting with acute transient amnesia, 114 fulfilled the proposed strict diagnostic criteria for transient global amnesia (TGA). The prognosis of this group was excellent with the exception of a small subgroup (7%), largely identifiable because of atypically brief or recurrent attacks, who developed epilepsy of temporal lobe type on follow up. Computerised tomography (CT) scans performed on 95 patients were normal, evidence for covert alcoholism was lacking and there was a familial incidence of approximately 2%. By contrast, the group of 39 patients who did not meet the criteria for TGA had a significantly worse prognosis with a high incidence of major vascular events. The groups could not be distinguished on the basis of behavioural characteristics during the attack. The following classification was proposed: 1) pure TGA--attacks fulfilling the strict criteria, and of more than one hour in duration which do not require detailed investigation, 2) probable epileptic amnesia--attacks of less than an hour or rapidly recurrent, 3) probable transient ischaemic amnesia, a minority of cases with additional focal neurological deficits during the attack.

       " '371': 'A comparison in vitro of human and rabbit distal colonic muscle responses to inflammatory mediators. The present study compared in vitro the motor responses of human and rabbit distal colonic longitudinal and circular muscle to acetylcholine, histamine, leukotrienes B4 and D4, and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha. The active and passive mechanical properties of these muscles were also evaluated. All muscle types were contracted by acetylcholine and histamine. Longitudinal muscle from both species was contracted by prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha, although rabbit muscle was more sensitive. Prostaglandin E2 relaxed the majority of both human and rabbit circular muscle preparations that were studied. Prostaglandin F2 alpha first relaxed and then contracted circular muscle from both species. Leukotriene B4 had no effect on any tissue studied. Leukotriene D4 caused transient relaxations in a proportion of all muscle types, but the relaxations were not concentration-related. Contractile responses did not differ under isotonic recording conditions, but relaxations were much more clearly defined. Based on experiments using atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, and pyrilamine or tetrodotoxin, it was concluded that the responses of both human and rabbit distal colonic muscles to these inflammatory mediators have a similar pharmacological basis. All muscle types exhibited low passive tension and developed active tension in the range 0.8-1.2 Lo. These data strongly support the belief that after the onset of an induced colitis, the rabbit colon has value as a predictive model for the study of inflammatory mediator-induced colonic motility changes in humans.

Twenty-two patients (44%) were imaged within 3 days after clinical ictus. Abnormalities detected with gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement were observed in 46 (92%) of 50 patients. Classic parenchymal enhancement was a late finding, observed in all patients (17 of 17) imaged at 7-14 days after infarction. Before this time, three additional phases of contrast material-related abnormalities were observed. Enhancement of vessels supplying the infarct (\"intravascular enhancement sign\") was the earliest finding, seen in 17 (77%) of 22 infarcts aged 1-3 days. From day 2 to day 6, abnormal enhancement of meninges adjacent to the infarct was frequently noted (\"meningeal enhancement sign\"). Finally, a transition phase that combined intravascular or meningeal enhancement with early parenchymal enhancement was seen from day 3 to day 6. Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging in early stroke reveals evidence of vascular engorgement and sluggish flow, which precede the development of classic parenchymal enhancement. ',\n",

The median duration of rehabilitation stay was 49 days. The mean functional independence score, as measured on a modified Barthel Index at admission was 44, compared with 78 on discharge, a mean improvement of 34. Stair climbing had the lowest mean value on admission (12), while bowel control had the lowest residual deficit on discharge (95). The stroke study group was representative of the unimpaired aged population in all respects except ethnicity, where differences are attributed to age.

In 15 spontaneously breathing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) divided into two groups, one with normocapnia (A) and one with chronic hypercapnia (B), we evaluated the maximal voluntary inspiratory muscle strength (MIP), the pattern of breathing, the mouth occlusion pressure (Po.1), the neural respiratory drive (NRD), assessed by surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the diaphragm (EMGd) and EMG activity of intercostal muscles (EMGint), and the chest wall neuromuscular coupling, assessed in terms of Po.1/EMGd ratio. Compared with an age-matched normal control group, both A and B groups exhibited lower MIP, significantly greater EMGd and EMGint, and lower Po.1/EMGd ratio. However, a similar pattern, along with a rapid and shallow breathing, differentiated group B from group A. In group B we found a significant direct relationship between Po.1/EMGd ratio and MIP, and an inverse relationship between PaCO2 and Po.1/EMGd ratio. These data seem to indicate the following: (1) EMG is a more precise method than Po.1 in assessing the magnitude of the NRD; (2) NRD is increased in these patients; and (3) clinical manifestations probably associated with inspiratory muscle fatigue (marked decrease in muscle strength, rapid and shallow breathing, and alveolar hypoventilation) may be accompanied by a greater NRD and a more marked derangement in chest wall neuromuscular coupling in COPD.

       " '375': 'Freehand allograft aortic valve replacement and aortic root replacement. Utility of intraoperative echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping. Seventeen consecutive patients undergoing 20 planned aortic valve replacements with allograft valves at Stanford University Medical Center were studied with intraoperative epicardial echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Native aortic valves were replaced in 12 of the 20 patients, and eight patients underwent second aortic valve procedures. In 17 of 20 patients allograft selection was guided by prebypass echocardiographic estimates of annular diameter and/or length of allograft aortic root required. Other prebypass findings included unanticipated severe mitral regurgitation in one patient (which precluded allograft aortic valve replacement), left-to-right shunts in five patients, ascending aortic dissection in one, and aortic root disease necessitating coronary reimplantation or bypass in two. Postbypass echocardiography demonstrated acceptable competency of 18 of 19 allograft valves (mild or no aortic insufficiency). Postbypass echocardiography also documented successful repair of four of five shunts and mild mitral regurgitation in 15 of 19 patients (versus 11 of 19 before bypass). Conclusions: Intraoperative echocardiography-Doppler mapping is a useful adjunct for allograft aortic valve or aortic root replacement; it allows confident selection of appropriate tissue size before aortic cross clamping, which minimizes delay from allograft thawing procedures. It also provides helpful information about the extent of aortic root disease and coronary ostial anatomy before bypass, confirms allograft competency after bypass, and detects accompanying valvular and other hemodynamic lesions before and after allograft valve replacement.

       " '376': 'A 170-kDa membrane-bound protease is associated with the expression of invasiveness by human malignant melanoma cells. Malignant spreading of cancer cells requires cell surface proteases that cleave the crosslinked collagenous matrix of connective tissues. From correlating the morphologically defined invasiveness of tumor cells with the presence of specific membrane-associated proteases, we have identified a malignant human melanoma cell line, LOX, that invades crosslinked gelatin films in vitro and contains uniquely a neutral 170-kDa gelatinase in the cell membrane. A similar gelatinase was found in membranes recovered from culture media conditioned with LOX. The 170-kDa gelatinase is a wheat germ agglutinin-binding protein. The proteolytic activity is maximal at neutral pH, enhanced by EDTA and dithiothreitol, inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide, HgCl2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and can bind to an organomercurial adsorbent, suggesting that it is a neutral sulfhydryl-sensitive protease. This 170-kDa gelatinase of LOX cells was not found in a control melanoma cell line, SK-MEL28, or in 32 other tumor cell lines that did not show extracellular gelatin degradation. Thus, we have identified a large membrane-bound protease that may be a specific marker molecule for melanoma cell invasiveness. ',\n",

Percutaneous catheter ablation using radiofrequency energy can be used to interrupt atrioventricular (AV) conduction in patients with supraventricular tachycardia refractory to drugs. Results of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction using a custom-designed catheter with a large, 3-mm-long distal electrode, 2-mm interelectrode spacing, and a shaft with increased torsional rigidity were compared with those using a standard quadripolar electrode catheter (Bard EP). An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied unmodulated radiofrequency current at 550 kHz, which was applied between the distal electrode of the ablation catheter and a large skin electrode. With use of the modified catheter, 12 of 13 patients (92%) had persistent complete AV block induced with 7 +/- 5 applications of 18 +/- 6 W of radiofrequency power. In contrast, complete AV block was produced in only 9 of 18 (50%) historical control patients treated with the standard catheter, despite a similar number of applications (7 +/- 5) and power output (16 +/- 4 W). A rise in impedance, due to desiccation of tissue and coagulum formation, occurred earlier (28 +/- 18 vs 52 +/- 24 seconds, p less than 0.001) and more frequently (54 vs 40% of applications, p = 0.047) in patients treated with the standard catheter than in patients treated with the modified catheter. The use of a catheter designed to increase the surface area of electrode-tissue contact allows more radiofrequency energy to be delivered before a rise in impedance occurs and appears to increase the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction.

Since 1983 percutaneous balloon dilatation of the right ventricular outflow tract has been performed as an alternative to surgical palliation in selected cases of tetralogy of Fallot at the Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital. From 31 December 1984 to 31 December 1988, 27 of these patients underwent subsequent surgical correction. Age at operation ranged from 7 to 58 months (median 2.7 years). The mean interval between balloon dilatation and correction was 15.6 months (range 3-39 months). Two patients had a systemic pulmonary shunt operation performed before dilatation and a further five required one afterwards. Overall 20 (74%) patients had some anatomical alteration as the result of balloon dilatation, while in seven (26%) there was no discernible change in the right ventricular outflow tract. There was no consistent relation between the ratio of balloon size to pulmonary annulus diameter and the morphological findings. Balloon dilatation may obviate the need for systemic-pulmonary shunt at the expense of some structural damage, particularly to the posterior cusp. The present data suggest that dilatation does not bring about growth of the annulus to such an extent that transannular patch is no longer needed at intracardiac repair. \",\n",

It is a vast network of neurons widely dispersed throughout the gut. The ENS is a dominant regulator of gut function through the action of peptide and non-peptide neurotransmitters. The most intensively studied roles of the ENS have been the regulation of secretory processes, such as gastric acid secretion, and motility. It is clear, however, that the ENS plays a broader role in the regulation of other gut functions, including mucosal defense, the gut immune response, and sphincter function. Alterations in the regulation of gut function by the ENS are likely or suspected in a number of conditions, including achalasia, Hirschsprung's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Chagas' disease, chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, biliary dyskinesia, tachygastria, and irritable bowel syndrome.

This report examines the relationship of plasma drug concentration to analgesic effect following bolus doses of alfentanil, fentanyl and morphine and assesses individual differences in analgesic response among volunteers. We predicted that the 3 opioids would yield disparate analgesic profiles because their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics differ. Ten healthy volunteers received intravenous bolus doses of either alfentanil, fentanyl, morphine or normal saline on different days. We stimulated their teeth electrically and measured brain evoked potential (EP) and pain report (PR) repeatedly over 2 h to assess analgesic effect. Concurrently, we drew 18 blood samples to assess opioid plasma concentrations during the test period. The relationship between opioid plasma concentration and analgesic effect was well defined for alfentanil but ambiguous for morphine. Fentanyl exhibited a marked hysteresis. We observed noteworthy individual differences in analgesic response with all 3 drugs but these differences were greatest for morphine and least for alfentanil.

Breast tumor cell lines have been shown to secrete several distinct polypeptide growth factors, although conflicting results exist for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). In contrast a limited number of breast tumor cell lines have definitely been shown to secrete the high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that modify IGF actions. To characterize the types of IGFBPs that are secreted by breast tumor cell lines, conditioned medium was collected from seven separate tumor cell lines, three of which were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and four of which were ER positive. All three of the ER negative cell lines, MDA-231, MDA-330, and HS578T, secreted binding proteins of 49,000 and 43,000 Mr (IGFBP-3) as well as 29,000 (IGFBP-1) and 24,000 Mr. In contrast, all four ER positive cell lines secreted 34,000 (IGFBP-2) or 24,000 Mr forms, and none secreted the 49,000 and 43,000 or 29,000 Mr forms. BT-20, a cell line that is positive for ER messenger RNA (mRNA) but negative for ER protein, secreted predominantly a 34,000 Mr protein. The amount of total IGFBP activity released in 24 h ranged between 0.4 and 5.6 nM equivalents of IGFBP-1, and there was no significant difference between the ER positive and negative cell lines. The MCF-7 cells that produced predominantly 34,000 and 24,000 Mr forms showed a 1.8-fold increase in IGFBP secretion after estrogen stimulation. Immunoblotting and a specific RIA for IGFBP-1 showed that only the ER negative lines MDA-330, MDA-231, and HS578T secreted this form. Northern blotting analysis for the mRNA encoding this protein showed that both MDA-330 and MDA-231 contained a single 1.6 kilobase mRNA species that hybridized with an IGFBP-1 complementary DNA (cDNA) probe. Immunoblotting analysis of the other cell lines showed that only the 34,000 Mr form secreted by the ER positive cell lines reacted with IGFBP-2 antisera. Exposure of the conditioned media from the three ER negative cell lines to N-glycanase revealed that the 49,000 and 43,000 Mr forms of IGFBP were glycosylated and therefore probably represent IGFBP-3. We conclude that ER negative cell lines secrete three forms of IGFBPs, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and a 24,000 Mr form.

In 6 patients with normal transit, balloon distention in the jejunum was perceived at a lower volume (32.7 +/- 5.9 mL) than in controls (46.6 +/- 3.0 mL). Pressure responses to balloon distention were reduced in 5 and exaggerated in 1 patient; abnormal efferent vagal (2 patients) and sympathetic (1 patient) function were also documented. In view of the normal transit, motility, and jejunal pressure responses to neostigmine in all 6 patients, the abnormal response to distention suggests afferent dysfunction. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogenous disorder. Abnormal transit is sometimes associated with disorders of extrinsic neural control, but the latter are also found in patients with normal transit. Increased perception of intraluminal stimuli in those with normal transit suggests a disturbance in afferent function. ',\n",
       " '392': 'Transforming growth factor beta 1 suppresses acute and chronic arthritis in experimental animals. Systemic administration of the cytokine, TGF beta 1, profoundly antagonized the development of polyarthritis in susceptible rats. TGF beta 1 administration (1 or 5 micrograms/animal), initiated one day before an arthritogenic dose of streptococcal cell wall (SCW) fragments, virtually eliminated the joint swelling and distortion typically observed during both the acute phase (articular index, AI = 2.5 vs. 11; P less than 0.025) and the chronic phase (AI = 0 vs. 12.5) of the disease. Moreover, TGF beta 1 suppressed the evolution of arthritis even when administration was begun after the acute phase of the disease. Histopathological examination of the joint revealed the systemic TGF beta 1 treatment greatly reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, pannus formation, and joint erosion. Consistent with the inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment into the synovium, TGF beta 1 reversed the leukocytosis associated with the chronic phase of the arthritis. Control animals subjected to the same TGF beta 1 dosing regimen displayed no discernable immunosuppressive or toxic effects even after 4 wk of treatment. These observations not only provide insight into the immunoregulatory effects of TGF beta, but also implicate this cytokine as a potentially important therapeutic agent. ',\n",

Given the scarcity of donor organ availability, the expense of the transplantation process and follow-up care, as well as the tremendous emotional burden the process places on a patient and his/her family, it is essential to carefully screen potential candidates for their symptomatic, functional, hemodynamic, and psychosocial eligibility, and to rule out coexisting hemodynamic or comorbid conditions that would jeopardize successful transplantation and immunosuppression.

To determine the role of thrombin in high blood flow, platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes we measured the relative antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects in baboons of hirudin, a highly potent and specific antithrombin, and compared the effects of heparin, an antithrombin III-dependent inhibitor of thrombin. Thrombus formation was determined in vivo using three relevant models (homologous endarterectomized aorta, collagen-coated tubing, and Dacron vascular graft) by measuring: (1) platelet deposition, using gamma camera imaging of 111In-platelets; (2) fibrin deposition, as assessed by the incorporation of circulating 125I-fibrinogen; and (3) occlusion. The continuous intravenous infusion of 1, 5, and 20 nmol/kg per minute of recombinant hirudin (desulfatohirudin) maintained constant plasma levels of 0.16 +/- 0.03, 0.79 +/- 0.44, and 3.3 +/- 0.77 mumol/mL, respectively. Hirudin interrupted platelet and fibrin deposition in a dose-dependent manner that was profound at the highest dose for all three thrombogenic surfaces and significant at the lowest dose for thrombus formation on endarterectomized aorta. Thrombotic occlusion was prevented by all doses studied. In contrast, heparin did not inhibit either platelet or fibrin deposition when administered at a dose that maximally prolonged clotting times (100 U/kg) (P greater than .1), and only intermediate effects were produced at 10-fold that dose (1,000 U/kg). Moreover, heparin did not prevent occlusion of the test segments. Hirudin inhibited platelet hemostatic function in concert with its antithrombotic effects (bleeding times were prolonged by the intermediate and higher doses). By comparison, intravenous heparin failed to affect the bleeding time at the 100 U/kg dose (P greater than .5), and only minimally prolonged the bleeding time at the 1,000 U/kg dose (P less than .05). We conclude that platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes are thrombin-mediated and that the biologic antithrombin hirudin produces a potent, dose-dependent inhibition of arterial thrombus formation that greatly exceeds the minimal antithrombotic effects produced by heparin.

Decreased cell mediated cytotoxicity occurs frequently in inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in patients with active disease. It is not clear, however, whether this decrease is caused by the disease or is a consequence of the medical treatment. In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in five patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission and in four healthy control subjects in a double blind randomised crossover trial preceded and separated by four weeks of treatment with placebo. The natural killer cell activity was significantly impaired in 67% (six of nine subjects) after four weeks' sulphasalazine treatment and tended to be related to subjects with a slow acetylator phenotype. In contrast, 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment caused only a marginal reaction in the natural killer cell activity in 22% (two of nine subjects). The inhibitory effects were found to be reversible since the decreased natural killer cell activity was completely restored after placebo treatment in all subjects. In conclusion, in vivo treatment with sulphasalazine inhibits the in vitro natural killer cell activity and this seems to be mediated by the sulphapyridine moiety. This phenomenon may contribute to the low natural killer cell activity found in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease. \",\n",

Chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by fusion of the bcr and abl genes on chromosomes 22 and 9, respectively. In most cases, the fusion involves a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), which produces the cytogenetically distinctive Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Fusion can be detected by Southern (DNA) analysis or by in vitro amplification of the messenger RNA from the fusion gene with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques are sensitive but cannot be applied to single cells. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with probes from portions of the bcr and abl genes to detect the bcr-abl fusion in individual blood and bone marrow cells from six patients. The fusion event was detected in all samples analyzed, of which three were cytogenetically Ph1-negative. One of the Ph1-negative samples was also PCR-negative. This approach is fast and sensitive, and provides potential for determining the frequency of the abnormality in different cell lineages. ',\n",

Intraoperative administration of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin causes reduction in blood loss and homologous blood requirement in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. To ascertain the blood-saving effect of aprotinin and to obtain further information about the mode of action, 40 patients undergoing primary myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to receive either aprotinin or placebo treatment. Aprotinin was given as a bolus of 2 x 10(6) kallikrein inactivator units (KIU) before surgery followed by a continuous infusion of 5 x 10(5) KIU/h during surgery. Additionally, 2 x 10(6) KIU were added to the pump prime. Strict criteria were used to obtain a homogeneous patient selection. Total blood loss was reduced from 1,431 +/- 760 ml in the control group to 738 +/- 411 ml in the aprotinin group (P less than 0.05) and the homologous blood requirement from 838 +/- 963 ml to 163 +/- 308 ml (P less than 0.05).

Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is invasive, rapidly performed, cheap, and accurate and has a primary role in documenting intra-abdominal bleeding or contamination in hypotensive patients with blunt trauma or selected stable patients with penetrating stab wounds. It misses small and large injuries to the diaphragm and cannot rule out injury to retroperitoneal structures. Computed tomography is noninvasive, time consuming to perform, expensive, and accurate and has a primary role in defining the location and magnitude of intra-abdominal injuries in stable patients with blunt trauma or with penetrating trauma to the flank or back.

The mice were randomly divided into four groups: group IA (LAK + IL-2) (N = 25) received 2 X 10(7) human lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from normal donors by tail vein injection followed by 10,000 units of human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) given intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 28 days; group IB (IL-2) (N = 27) was given the same dose of IL-2 alone; group IC (RPMI-1640) (N = 18) received a placebo consisting of 1 ml of RPMI-1640 intraperitoneally every 12 hours; and group ID (LAK) (N = 14) received 2 X 10(7) LAK cells but no IL-2. Toxicity was significantly higher in group IB, with a mortality rate of 45.5% (10/22 animals) versus a 0% mortality (0/25) in group IA. None of the group IA or IB animals died of pancreatic cancer during the experiment. The animals that did not receive IL-2 died before 28 days in 14.2% of group IC and in 16.7% of group ID. The area under the growth curve of subcutaneous tumors during the course of treatment and the pancreatic tumor weight at the end of treatment were compared in each group. Subcutaneous tumors had a reduced rate of growth in group IA animals compared to all the other treatments. Pancreatic tumor growth was slowed in group IA. The animals treated with IL-2 alone (group IB) showed some slowing of tumor growth that was intermediate between group IA, group IC, and group ID. A similar experiment was done with irradiated (375 rad) mice. Nine nude mice with tumors were treated with LAK + IL-2 (group IIA), eight received IL-2 alone (group IIB), and seven received placebo (group IIC). The antitumor effect of IL-2 alone was not present in the irradiated mice. A highly significant difference persisted between group IIA and all other groups. There was no difference in the histologic characteristics of tumors in control mice and in mice with inhibited tumor growth treated with IL-2 or IL-2 and human LAK cells. These results show that adoptive immunotherapy with human LAK cells and human recombinant IL-2 is effective against human pancreatic cancer growing in nude mice. This effect is independent from antitumor activity from IL-2 administrations alone. ',\n",

Thirteen patients (5.6%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral infarction was noted in eight, cerebral hemorrhage in two, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in three. In seven (54%) of these 13 patients, stroke occurred less than or equal to 5 years after systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed. Among the predisposing risk factors for stroke, hypertension was the most important. Lupus anticoagulant was detected in three (38%) and anticardiolipin antibody in three (43% of seven investigated) of the patients with infarction. Evaluation of the clinical manifestations and autoantibodies indicated that renal involvement and high titers of anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibody were more frequent in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group. Autopsy studies on six of the patients with stroke revealed small infarcts and hemorrhages in all, but in no case was true angiitis observed. Libman-Sacks endocarditis was found in two of the three patients with infarction. In conclusion, the important contributory factor to the development of stroke in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is considered to be hypertension mediated by immunologic abnormalities. Antiphospholipid antibodies and Libman-Sacks endocarditis are closely associated with occlusive cerebrovascular disease. ',\n",

Lack of information regarding the presence of native albumin polymer in serum and its structural similarity to the one produced by glutaraldehyde treatment casts doubt on the postulate that hepatitis B virus attachment to hepatocytes is mediated through polymerized albumin. We used a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with murine monoclonal antibodies raised against glutaraldehyde-polymerized albumin to detect native albumin polymer in human serum and its cross-reactivity with other albumin polymers. Presence of polymerized albumin receptor on the HepG2 cell was studied by radioreceptor assay. Purified hepatitis B virus and synthetic peptide analogous to part of pre-S2 sequence (120-145) were used to study polymerized albumin-dependent attachment of the virus to HepG2 cells. Antibodies raised against pre-S2 peptide were used to inhibit the pre-S2 and hepatitis B virus attachment to HepG2 cells. Glutaraldehyde-treated polymerized albumin was found to be immunologically cross-reactive with native albumin polymer. Its levels were found to be significantly raised in sera of patients with liver diseases. Polymerized albumin has specific saturable receptor on HepG2 cells with two classes of binding sites of different equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd1 = (16 +/- 9.6)pmol/L and Kd2 = (1,019 +/- 172)pmol/L.

Resting energy expenditure and plasma catecholamines were normal in all three groups. The basal rate of glycerol appearance in blood in the patients with cancer (2.96 +/- 0.45 mumol.kg-1.min-1) was similar to that in the nutritionally matched controls (3.07 +/- 0.28 mumol.kg-1.min-1), but 48% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers (2.00 +/- 0.16 mumol.kg-1.min-1) (P = 0.028). The antilipolytic effect of propranolol and the rate of triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in the patients with cancer were also similar in the cachectic control group and approximately 50% greater than in the normal-weight volunteers, but the differences were not statistically significant because of the variability in the data. We conclude that the increase in lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in \"unstressed\" cachectic patients with esophageal cancer is due to alterations in their nutritional status rather than the presence of tumor itself.

The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of comorbidity between MDD/PD and mitral valve prolapse in a group of patients with non-CAD chest pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography for suspected CAD who were 70 years of age or younger and without other significant medical illnesses or cardiac complications were eligible for study. The first 100 patients who agreed to a psychiatric diagnostic interview were recruited. RESULTS: Forty-eight of the 100 patients were found to be without significant CAD. Forty-two percent of these patients, compared to 19% of the patients with significant CAD, were found to have either MDD, PD, or both. Eighty percent of the patients without CAD who had mitral valve prolapse also had either MDD or PD (p less than 0.006).

It becomes apparent from this study that the titer of hepatitis B surface antigen in the aspirated irrigating solution is almost the same level as that in the serum. We therefore strongly recommend that eye shields should be used in hepatic surgery when the ultrasonic dissector is in use. ',\n",

The author proposes the term 'vertical partial laryngectomy on demand' for all modifications of vertical laryngectomies (frontal, frontolateral, vertical and hemilaryngectomy). This term includes two conditions: the first is complete oncological removal of the tumour (proven by histological examination and with the use of magnification or the operating microscope during the operation); secondly, reconstruction of the laryngeal defect by various procedures. The author uses the sternohyoid fascia in vertical and frontolateral partial laryngectomies. From 120 operated cases, a five-year survival rate of 81 per cent was achieved.

The performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple in 1935 demonstrated that the operation was feasible technically and compatible with reasonable function after recovery. From the mid- to late 1940s until the last 10 years, the procedure was condemned by many because of its associated mortality and morbidity. For reasons that are not clear, the risk of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 10 years has fallen to less than 10% and in several centers, less than 5%. Postoperative complications have been reduced and blood transfusions are unnecessary in an increasing number of patients. Furthermore, a normal productive life without the need for medication and with no digestive disorder is expected. Seventy-one percent of patients are able to return to their preoperative occupation.

       " '424': 'Diagnostic relevance of clonal cytogenetic aberrations in malignant soft-tissue tumors. BACKGROUND. Malignant soft-tissue tumors often present substantial diagnostic challenges. Chromosome aberrations that might be diagnostic have been identified in some types of soft-tissue tumors, but the overall frequency and diagnostic relevance of these aberrations have not been established. METHODS. We attempted to determine the karyotypes of a series of 62 consecutive, unselected malignant spindle-cell or small round-cell soft-tissue tumors (from 46 adults and 16 children) after direct harvesting of cells or short-term culture. All tumors were examined independently by immunohistochemical staining in addition to routine light-microscopical evaluation, and all but two tumors were examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS. Metaphases were obtained from 61 of the 62 tumors, and clonal chromosome aberrations were identified in 55 (89 percent). In the six tumors that yielded metaphases but lacked apparent clonal aberrations, the normal metaphases were found to originate from non-neoplastic stromal elements within the tumor specimens. Thus, all tumors in which karyotyping was successful contained clonal chromosome aberrations. Forty of 62 tumors (65 percent) contained clonal chromosome aberrations that either suggested or confirmed a specific diagnosis; in 15 of these tumors (24 percent of all tumors), the aberrations were important in establishing the final diagnosis. Cytogenetic analyses were particularly informative about small round-cell tumors from children: 8 of 14 round-cell tumors contained diagnostically important chromosome aberrations. Using the combined approaches of light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetics, we established an unambiguous diagnosis for 60 of 62 tumors. CONCLUSIONS. Cytogenetic analyses reveal clonal chromosome aberrations in virtually all malignant soft-tissue tumors. These clonal chromosome aberrations, particularly in small round-cell tumors in children, often have diagnostic relevance. ',\n",

The protective effect of low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution on ischemic myocardium has been assessed in adult patients undergoing heart operations. Postreperfusion recovery of cardiac function and electrical activity was evaluated in 34 patients; 16 received low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution (group I) and 18 received St. Thomas' Hospital solution, which is enriched with calcium and magnesium (group II). There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, sex, body weight, and New York Heart Association functional class. Aortic occlusion time (107.3 +/- 46.8 minutes versus 113.6 +/- 44.3 minutes), highest myocardial temperature during elective global ischemia (11.5 degrees C +/- 3.1 degrees C versus 9.3 degrees C +/- 3.2 degrees C), and total volume of cardioplegic solution (44.2 +/- 20.5 ml/kg versus 43.4 +/- 17.6 ml/kg) were also similar in the two groups. On reperfusion, electrical defibrillation was required in four cases (25.5%) in group I and in 15 cases (83.3%) in group II (p less than 0.005), and bradyarrhythmias were significantly more prevalent in group II (6.3% versus 44.4%; p less than 0.05). Serum creatine kinase MB activity at 15 minutes of reperfusion (12.3 +/- 17.0 IU/L versus 42.6 +/- 46.1 IU/L; p less than 0.05) and the dose of dopamine or dobutamine required during the early phase of reperfusion (1.8 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg/min versus 6.1 +/- 3.3 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.0002) were both significantly greater in group II. Postischemic left ventricular function, as assessed by percent recovery of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement alone, was significantly better in group I (160.4% +/- 45.5% versus 47.8% +/- 12.9%; p less than 0.05). Serum level of calcium and magnesium ions was significantly lower in group I. Thus low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution provided excellent protection of the ischemic heart, whereas St. Thomas' Hospital solution with calcium and magnesium enabled relatively poor functional and electrical recovery of the heart during the early reperfusion period. These results might be related to differing levels of extracellular calcium and magnesium on reperfusion. \",\n",

Retrospective review of 291 solid tumor and lymphoma patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed to determine the influence of pretransplant characteristics and preparative regimen to the development of hepatic venoocclusive disease (VOD). Twelve patients (4.1%) developed a clinical syndrome of right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness or hepatomegaly, jaundice, and ascites, with or without encephalopathy, within 40 days of marrow reinfusion. Evidence of metastatic liver disease was the only pretransplant characteristic predictive for VOD (P = .0002). Sex, age, histology, hepatitis B serology, and elevated liver function tests were not predictive. No individual preparative agent had a significant effect on the development of VOD. However, a single 2-hour infusion of carmustine (BCNU) (greater than or equal to 450 mg/m2) led to an increased incidence of VOD when compared with the same dose administered in a fractionated schedule (P = .0258) when given with two other chemotherapeutic agents. Seven of eight autopsy specimens confirmed the clinical diagnosis of VOD. The four patients in whom clinical VOD resolved had lower median peak bilirubins (7.3 v 15.9 mg/dL), lower median peak creatinines (2.1 v 4.1 mg/dL), and relatively quick engraftment of neutrophils (mean, 18.7 days). One of the four patients in whom VOD resolved had other grade 4 (life-threatening) toxicities in contrast to eight of eight who succumbed. In summary, VOD is an uncommon complication in autotransplantation of solid tumors and lymphomas. Our data suggest caution in selecting patients with known metastatic liver disease and consideration of a fractionated BCNU schedule especially in combination with other alkylating agents. ',\n",
       " '427': 'Low-molecular-weight heparinoid compared with warfarin for prophylaxis of deep-vein thrombosis in patients who are operated on for fracture of the hip. A prospective, randomized trial. In a randomized, prospective trial, a low-molecular-weight heparinoid (Org 10172 [Lomoparan]) was compared with warfarin for efficacy and safety in preventing deep-vein thrombosis in 263 patients who had an operatively treated fracture of the hip. One group of patients received Org 10172 in a dose of 750 units subcutaneously every twelve hours until the ninth postoperative day; on the seventh postoperative day, warfarin was added to the regimen. The other group received only warfarin. Both drugs were begun preoperatively, immediately after the admission evaluation. In the patients who received warfarin, the desired prothrombin time was one and one-half times the control level. Deep-vein thrombosis was detected by 125I-fibrinogen scanning and impedance plethysmography and was confirmed by phlebography and compression ultrasonography. Deep-vein thrombosis was found in nine (7 per cent) of the 132 patients who received Org 10172 and in twenty-eight (21 per cent) of the 131 patients who received warfarin (p less than 0.001). Adverse reactions were not significantly different in the two groups. Major bleeding complications occurred in eight patients in the Org-10172 group, only four of whom were receiving the drug at the time of bleeding, and in five patients who were receiving warfarin (not significant). There was no difference in intraoperative loss of blood or in requirements for transfusion. We concluded that the low-molecular-weight heparinoid Org 10172 is a safe, convenient, effective antithrombotic agent for the prevention of venous thrombosis after an operation for fracture of the hip.

       " '428': 'Transvascular intracardiac applications of a miniaturized phased-array ultrasonic endoscope. Initial experience with intracardiac imaging in piglets. BACKGROUND. Recent advances in miniaturization of phased-array and mechanical ultrasound devices have resulted in exploration of alternative approaches to cardiac and vascular imaging in the form of transesophageal or intravascular imaging. Preliminary efforts in adapting phased-array endoscopes designed for transesophageal use to a transvascular approach have used full-sized phased-array devices introduced directly into the right atrium in open-chested animals. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a custom-made, very small phased-array endoscope for intracardiac imaging introduced intravascularly through a jugular venous approach in young piglets. METHODS AND RESULTS. Experimental atrial septal defects created in four piglets (3-4 weeks old) had been closed with a buttoned atrial septal defect closure device consisting of an occluder in the left atrium and a counteroccluder in the right atrium. Five to 15 days after atrial septal defect closure, the piglets were returned to the experimental laboratory, where a 6.3-mm, 17-element, 5-MHz phased-array probe mounted on a 4-mm endoscope was introduced through a cutdown incision of the external jugular vein and advanced to the right atrium. From the right atrium all four cardiac chambers, their inflows and outflows, and all four valves were well imaged with minimal superior and inferior rotation. High-resolution imaging of the atrial septum defined with anatomical accuracy, later verified by autopsy, the exact placement of both the occluder and counteroccluder in the left and right sides of the atrial septal defects and the absence of any shunting across the atrial septum in any of the four animals. CONCLUSIONS. Our efforts indicate that transvascular passage of small phased-array probes can be easily accomplished and is a promising technique for detailed visualization of cardiac structures. This approach may provide an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography, particularly for guiding interventional procedures such as placement of transcatheter closure devices in pediatric patients.

       " '429': 'Fundoplication and gastrostomy in familial dysautonomia. Fundoplication with gastrostomy has become a frequent treatment for patients with familial dysautonomia, so we evaluated the use of both procedures in 65 patients. Although patients differed widely in presenting signs and age, from 5 weeks to 40 years, gastroesophageal reflux was documented in 95% of patients by cineradiography or pH monitoring. Panendoscopy was a useful adjunct. Preoperative symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux included vomiting, respiratory infections, and exaggerated autonomic dysfunction. Severe oropharyngeal incoordination frequently coexisted and resulted in misdirected swallows with aspiration, dependence on gavage feedings, or poor weight gain and dehydration. Follow-up after surgical correction ranged from 3 months to 11 years; 55 patients (85%) were available for a 1-year postoperative assessment. We had no instances of surgical death. The long-term mortality rate was 14%, primarily related to severe preexisting respiratory disease. Beyond the first postoperative year, 30 patients had pneumonia attributed to continued aspiration, exacerbation of preexisting lung disease, or recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux. Of 11 patients who vomited postoperatively, six had recurrence of reflux. Recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux was documented in eight patients (12%), and we revised the fundoplication in three patients. The number of patients with cyclic crises was reduced from 18 to 7; retching replaced overt vomiting in all but two of these seven patients, neither of whom had recurrence of reflux. Because oropharyngeal incoordination was prominent, concomitant use of gastrostomy and an antireflux procedure was especially effective in the treatment of younger patients with familial dysautonomia, before the development of severe respiratory disease. Despite the development of severe morning nausea in 15 patients, the combination procedure resulted in significantly improved nutritional status, decreased vomiting, and decreased respiratory problems. Appropriate use of gastrostomy feedings also contributed to success of the operation. The generally good outcome of fundoplication with gastrostomy confirms the benefit of this procedure in familial dysautonomia. ',\n",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine empirically how many patients are identified as delirious or nondelirious according to DMS-III, DMS-III-R, and ICD-10 criteria. METHOD: Daily, a trained research assistant using a structured instrument to detect the presence of symptoms of delirium evaluated 325 elderly patients who were admitted to a general hospital for acute medical problems. Each patient's symptoms were then compared with these diagnostic criteria sets to determine if the patient met criteria for delirium. RESULTS: DSM-III criteria were the most inclusive: they identified 125 patients as delirious. DSM-III-R identified a somewhat different group of 106 patients as delirious. ICD-10 criteria identified only 30 patients as delirious. CONCLUSIONS: The development of new criteria for delirium (e.g., DSM-IV) will have to balance the need to define a pure group of patients for research purposes with the need to include cases of clinical interest. Changes in criteria should be based on data such as those presented in this paper. \",\n",

In 33% of patients referred for infrainguinal reconstruction for limb-threatening ischemia (mean preoperative ankle-arm index [AAI] = 0.26), no suitable autogenous reconstruction was possible. In 40% of cases, intraoperative pre-bypass contrast arteriography was necessary to identify a graftable tibial or pedal artery. The results of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and autogenous bypasses were compared after 1 to 3 years. After 1 year, patency was 85% and 67% for autogenous and PTFE bypasses, respectively. Limb salvage was 90% for autogenous bypass and 70% for PTFE bypass. Cumulative patency rates at 3 years were 80% for autogenous and 57% for PTFE grafts. Graft surveillance with duplex scanning and AAI was valuable in detecting failing grafts. For both types of reconstruction, secondary procedures were required to maintain patency. We attribute the excellent results with PTFE in part to long-term aspirin and warfarin therapy. In cases of combined superficial femoral and severe infra-popliteal occlusive disease, PTFE bypass is an excellent alternative when no autogenous conduit is available. ',\n",
       " '434': \"A hematologist's view of contrast media, clotting in angiography syringes and thrombosis during coronary angiography. While ionic contrast media (CM) are stronger anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, both nonionic and ionic CM retard clotting, fibrinopeptide A generation and platelet aggregation (at least by Born-O'Brien aggregometry). Thus, nonionic CM do not cause clots and thrombi. Rather, the driving force for clot or thrombus formation, when it occurs, is blood contact with and activation by the foreign surface of a syringe or catheter itself. A marked enhancement of clotting by glass syringes in comparison to plastic ones supports this view. Blood in any syringe or catheter, therefore, will clot more slowly in the presence of nonionic or ionic CM, the inhibitory effects of the latter being more profound. With respect to models of thrombosis at sites of vascular injury or stenosis, the antithrombotic effects of CM may either be transient owing to the dynamic nature of blood flow (local endothelial cell denudation model), or as in the case of ionic CM, actually to enhance local platelet aggregation (stenosis model). In these situations, preservation of the antithrombotic functions of endothelium with nonionic CM may be quite critical. \",\n",

Once calibration procedures were performed, SvO2 measured by the catheter and by an hemoximeter OSM 3 (reference value) were compared following each therapeutic intervention. Over a period of 1.5 to 6 hours during which the hematocrit value remained unchanged, 119 measurements were obtained in group 1, 91 in group 2 and 181 in group 3. The dispersion of SvO2 values was much more pronounced with the two-reference wavelength systems using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments, and the correlation coefficient was significantly higher with the three-reference wavelength system (r = 0.970 for the Oximetrix catheter vs r = 0.855 for the Edwards catheter and r = 0.826 for the Spectramed catheter, p less than 0.001). After 24 hours, the spontaneous drifts in the two-reference wavelength systems, using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments (expressed as the SvO2 value measured by the catheter minus the reference SvO2 value) were significantly higher than the spontaneous drift in the three-reference wavelength system (9.3 +/- 7 percent for the Edwards catheter and +/- 6 +/- 4.1 percent for the Spectramed catheter vs 3.3 +/- 3.1 percent for the Oximetrix catheter, p less than 0.05). This study shows that a three-wavelength system is more accurate than a two-wavelength system for measuring acute changes in SvO2. The addition of a second detecting fiber optic filament does not seem to improve the accuracy of the system when SvO2 changes occur in conditions of stable hematocrit. ',\n",

The role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) as a mediator of pancreatic inflammation was examined in the rat pancreatic duct ligation model of obstructive pancreatitis. Pancreatic generation of PAF, as measured by bioassay (ie, platelet [3H]serotonin secretion), was determined at various times after induction of inflammation. Tissue levels of PAF in the normal pancreas averaged 600 +/- 49 pg/g, but PAF was not detectable during the initial 24 hours of pancreatitis, a time when the inflammatory reaction would be considered acute, that is, during the period of maximal serum amylase release and the development of interstitial edema. However a substantial increase in pancreatic PAF levels (12 times control levels) was observed 7 to 14 days after duct ligation during the late-phase response interval similar to the situation characteristic of chronic pancreatitis in which parenchymal atrophy, fibrosis, and pancreatic insufficiency evolve. One week after duct ligation when PAF levels peaked, an evaluation was made of the effects of PAF antagonists (BN52021 and WEB2170) on pancreatic lesions using Evan's blue extravasation, pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and acid phosphatase activity in peritoneal lavage fluid. BN52021 or WEB2170 treatment was shown to reduce pancreatic damage and inflammation significantly. Long-term in vivo administration of exogenous PAF (20 micrograms/kg/hr for 7 days) exhibited a reduction of [3H]thymidine uptake into and amylase release from pancreatic acini in vitro. Our observations 1) that pancreatic PAF levels increased significantly during the chronic phase of obstructive pancreatitis induced by duct ligation; 2) that inhibition of the action of PAF, through specific receptor antagonism, caused an attenuation of pancreatic lesions; and 3) that chronic administration of PAF resulted in decreased pancreatic regeneration and exocrine function are consistent with a pivotal role for PAF as a late-phase inflammatory mediator in chronic pancreatitis in rats. \",\n",

The extent of abnormal left ventricular perfusion was quantified from computer-generated polar maps of three-dimensional myocardial radioactivity. Patients with only a moderate (51% to 69%) stenosis tended to have a small perfusion defect irrespective of the coronary artery involved. Whereas a perfusion defect measuring greater than or equal to 10% of the left ventricle was found in 78% of patients with no prior infarction and severe (greater than or equal to 70%) stenosis, this was observed in only 24% of patients with moderate stenosis. Perfusion defect size increased with increasing severity of stenosis for the entire group without infarction and for those with left anterior descending, right and circumflex coronary artery stenosis. However, the correlation between stenosis severity and perfusion defect size was at best only modest (r = 0.38, p = 0.0001). The left anterior descending artery was shown to be the most important of the three coronary arteries for providing left ventricular perfusion. Proximal stenosis of this artery produced a perfusion defect approximately twice as large as that found in patients with a proximal right or circumflex artery stenosis. However, marked heterogeneity in perfusion defect size existed among all three vessels despite comparable stenosis severity. This was most apparent for the left anterior descending coronary artery, where mid vessel stenosis commonly produced a perfusion defect similar in size to that found in proximally stenosed vessels.

       " '448': 'Host genetic influences on fetal susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus after maternal or fetal infection. Genetically determined resistance to murine cytomegalovirus is observed in adult mice and is mediated in part by genes of the H-2 complex, with the H-2k haplotype conferring resistance. This model was used to examine the effect of primary maternal infection on fetal outcome. The severity of fetal growth retardation and death after primary maternal infection on day 8 of pregnancy was found to be genetically determined. Fetal viability and weight were significantly lower in infected BALB/c mothers (H-2d) than in CBA(H-2k) and BALB.K(H-2k) mothers. However, fetal infection was not detected, suggesting that the resistance mechanisms operate at the level of the mother or placenta. By directly inoculating fetuses in utero, it was shown that genetic factors in the fetus can influence the level of fetal infection and viability. These results point to the possibility that host genetic factors may modulate maternal and fetal cytomegalovirus infections in humans. ',\n",

Three antigenic polypeptides were recognized when immunoblotted against protein extracts from HeLa cell nuclei or from chromosomal segments enriched with centromere region. These were a 17 kDa (CENP-A recognized by 34 sera), an 80 kDa (CENP-B recognized by 33 sera), and a 140 kDa polypeptide (CENP-C recognized by 26 sera). There was no disease specific pattern of antigenic polypeptides, although Raynaud's phenomenon was frequent in patients with anti-CENP-B reactivities (p less than 0.01). The heterogeneity of the anticentromere antibody response in Japanese patients shows anticentromere antibody may not be a disease specific autoantibody and diagnostic marker. \",\n",
       " '450': 'Clinical perspective on celiprolol: cardioprotective potential. beta-Adrenergic blockers have had widespread use in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Some agents of this class have been shown to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death, and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The mechanism for this cardioprotective action is not known. Antiarrhythmic action and hemodynamic alterations have been suggested as possible mechanisms. An anticoagulant mechanism is another possibility, although the antiplatelet effects of beta-blockers are weak. It is now believed that antithrombotic effects may be related to the prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than a direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability beta-blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surgers, as they do in aortic dissection, may protect a vulnerable plaque from fracture, reducing the risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Celiprolol, a third-generation beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker with partial beta 2-agonist activity, is comparable to other beta-blockers in antihypertensive and antianginal activity. It has additional actions that may be beneficial to patients: (1) it does not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins; (2) it does not appear to depress the myocardium in patients with left ventricular dysfunction; (3) it can lower serum fibrinogen levels; and (4) it can cause regression of myocardial mass in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.

It has been proposed that among the various cell-surface proteins capable of interacting with laminin, the 67-kd high-affinity laminin receptor plays a crucial role during tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, the expression of laminin-receptor-precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and 67-kd protein was analyzed in human colon adenocarcinoma. In 22 of 23 patients with colon cancer, we found a 2- to 23-fold increase in levels of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA in the cancer tissues compared with those in matched normal adjacent colonic mucosa. In 10 of 11 cases studied, the level of 67-kd laminin receptor, detected by affinity-purified anti-laminin-receptor synthetic peptide antibodies on immunoblots of matched tumor and normal tissue extracts, was higher in the colon carcinoma tissue. Immunodetection of laminin receptor in tissue sections using anti-laminin-receptor-peptide antibodies confirmed that the increased expression of laminin receptor was specifically associated with the cancer cells. In a series of 72 paraffin sections of colon lesions, we observed a correlation between the expression of the laminin receptor and the Dukes' classification. Our observations indicate that increased expression of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA is associated with enhanced levels of the 67-kd laminin receptor as well as with the invasive phenotype of colon carcinoma. Detection of this metastasis-associated gene product may be a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of human colon cancer. \",\n",

From 1980 to 1988, the incidence of cerebral septic embolus was 42% (n = 45) among 106 patients with endocarditis who underwent valve replacement at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Of these 45 patients, 69% (n = 31) had symptomatic cerebral septic infarctions and 31% (n = 14) were asymptomatic. Findings on cerebral computed tomographic scans included ischemic infarcts (n = 36, 80%), hemorrhagic infarcts (n = 5, 11%), normal studies (n = 2, 4%), and unknown (n = 2, 4%). Neurological complications after valve replacement included postoperative strokes (n = 6, 6%), cerebral abscesses (n = 2, 2%), and seizure (n = 1, 1%).

Furthermore, the node positive group was evaluated to ascertain if the current staging system (Turnbull, 1967) is prognostically accurate for the Dukes\\' C group. Specifically evaluated for possible prognostic variance was the survival of those patients whose tumors demonstrated partial bowel wall penetration and only one to four positive nodes, a \"C1 subset,\" previously reported to have favorable prognosis.

In all these patients we believe the standard treatment would have included fecal diversion. Four patients sustained blunt trauma and five sustained penetrating trauma. Healing of the colonic anastomosis occurred in all cases, and the ICBTs were passed per rectum between the tenth and nineteenth days postoperatively.

The frequency of bifurcational obstruction in this setting requires familiarity with drainages from both the right and the left transhepatic approach. The preferred right transhepatic approach is fluoroscopically guided; on the left, ultrasonography is the guidance of choice. Large caliber drainage catheters are required, and dilatation of the necessary transhepatic tracts is extremely painful unless adequate inhalation anesthesia or, preferably, epidural anesthesia, is provided. Long-term biliary drainage requires a choice between internal-external external drainage catheters and endoprostheses that is made by considering the patient's life expectancy and his or her adjustment to a stent extending to the outside. The feasibility of corrective procedures if an internal-external drainage catheter or an endoprosthesis becomes blocked needs to be considered before definitive placement.

       " '459': 'Selection of patients with acute myocardial infarction for thrombolytic therapy PURPOSE: To critically review the current recommendations regarding the eligibility of patients with myocardial infarction for thrombolytic therapy. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Relevant studies published from January 1980 to January 1990 were identified through a computerized search of the English-language literature using MEDLINE and by a manual search of the bibliographies of all identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: All randomized, controlled trials of intravenous thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina were reviewed. Smaller, observational studies and previous review articles were included when relevant to the discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: Key data were extracted from each article, including the proportions of patients eligible for thrombolysis, the reasons for exclusion from thrombolytic therapy, and the clinical outcomes of patients treated and of those excluded from treatment. The validity of certain exclusion criteria was examined using subgroup analysis from the large, randomized mortality trials of intravenous thrombolysis and observations from smaller, nonrandomized studies. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: To date, relatively few patients with myocardial infarction have been considered eligible for fibrinolytic therapy. In this group, both early and late mortality have been significantly reduced. Patients excluded from thrombolysis, however, continue to have a high early mortality. The data suggest that the potential benefits of this treatment might be extended to selected high-risk subgroups. In particular, the risk-benefit ratio may favor the inclusion of otherwise healthy elderly patients; certain patients presenting more than 6 hours after the onset of symptoms; and patients with a history of controlled systolic hypertension or brief, nontraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The data do not support the use of fibrinolytic therapy as primary treatment in patients with unstable angina or suspected myocardial infarction in the absence of confirmatory electrocardiographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: The full potential of thrombolytic therapy to alter the natural history of acute myocardial infarction can only be realized through the continued evaluation of selection criteria and the identification and treatment of the greatest possible number of eligible patients.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to cytokeratins included MAb KA 1, which binds to polypeptide 5 in a complex with polypeptide 14 and recognizes preferentially myoepithelial cells; MAb KA4, which binds to polypeptides 14, 15, 16 and 19; individual MAbs to polypeptides 7, 13, and 16, 17, 18, and 19, and the MAb mixture AE1/AE3. The authors also applied three MAbs to vimentin (Vim), and three MAbs to glial filament protein (GFP). Selected samples were studied by double-label immunofluorescence microscopy and by staining sequential sections with some of the said MAbs, an MAb to alpha-smooth muscle actin, and well-characterized polyclonal antibodies for the possible coexpression of diverse types of cytoskeletal proteins. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis also were performed. All samples reacted for cytokeratins with MAbs AE1/AE3, although the reaction did not involve all cells. Monoclonal antibody KA4 stained preferentially the luminal-secretory cells in the normal breast and in FCD, whereas it stained the vast majority of cells in all carcinomas. Monoclonal antibody KA1 stained preferentially the basal-myoepithelial cells of the normal breast and FCD while staining tumor cell subpopulations in 4 of 31 carcinomas. Vimentin-positive cells were found in 8 of 12 normal breasts and in 12 of 20 FCD; in most cases, Vim-reactive cells appeared to be myoepithelial, but occasional luminal cells were also stained. Variable subpopulations of Vim-positive cells were noted in 9 of 20 ductal and in 1 of 7 lobular carcinomas. Glial filament protein-reactive cells were found in normal breast lobules and ducts and in 15 of 20 cases of FCD; with rare exceptions, GFP-reactivity was restricted to basally located, myoepithelial-appearing cells. Occasional GFP-reactive cells were found in 3 of 31 carcinomas. Evaluation of sequential sections and double-label immunofluorescence microscopy showed the coexpression of certain cytokeratins (possibly including polypeptides 14 and 17) with vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin together with GFP in some myoepithelial cells. The presence of GFP in myoepithelial cells was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.

Thirty-five patients for whom emergency sclerotherapy or conservative treatment, or both, failed to arrest variceal bleeding, or who had early rebleeding and required emergency portosystemic shunts (EPSS) were studied. EPSS permanently controlled the variceal bleeding in all but one patient. In this patient, the shunt was patent as demonstrated by angiography. Esophageal varices disappeared in 18 patients and were reduced in 14. Three patients died before the endoscopic examination could be performed. The causes of death were hepatic failure in two and bleeding ulcerations of the gastric fundus in the other patient. One patient was classified in Child's category B and two in Child's category C. Thirty-two patients submitted to EPSS and were discharged alive. Twelve of these patients subsequently died, at an average of 11.2 months after undergoing the shunt procedure. Four of 12 patients died of hepatic failure; two patients died of hepatomas; two, other neoplasia; three, hemorrhaging duodenal ulcers, and one patient, renal failure. Analysis of actuarial survival rates showed that the five year survival rate was 43 per cent. The long term survival rates were fewer for patients with Child's category C than for those with combined Child's categories A and B (five year survival rates were 21 versus 55 per cent; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had variceal bleeding. Chronic encephalopathy developed in six, which was mild in three, moderate in one instance and severe in two. It developed soon after EPSS, with onset in the first month after discharge in three. Thus, when conservative treatment fails to arrest variceal bleeding, EPSS should be performed to guarantee definitive control of hemorrhage and prolong the survival period. \",\n",

The final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 54 patients and chronic pancreatitis in 27 patients. CA 19-9 assessment, US, CT, and FNAB were considered nondiagnostic, respectively, in 0%, 25%, 19%, and 6% of cases. When a definite diagnosis was rendered, the positive predictive value was 90% for CA 19-9 assessment, 95% for US, 98% for CT, and 100% for FNAB; the negative predictive value was, respectively, 69%, 95%, 86%, and 100%. The accuracy of all diagnostic and nondiagnostic studies was 81% for CA 19-9 assessment, 72% for US, 77% for CT, and 94% for FNAB.

Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients). The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy. Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy. All required flap reconstruction. Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy. Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors. Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall. Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone. Results in patients with extensive lesions still leave much to be desired, despite radical surgery and aggressive radiotherapy.

We have recently demonstrated that two chloramphenicol (CAP) metabolites known to be produced by intestinal bacteria, dehydro-CAP (DH-CAP) and nitrophenylaminopropane (NPAP), are much more cytotoxic to bone marrow in vitro than CAP itself. Since colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play an essential role in hematopoietic cell growth, toxicity from CAP metabolites could also involve interaction with CSF or CSF-producing cells. In the present study, we found that increasing concentrations of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF completely reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP (2 x 10(-4) M) on human CFU-GM growth and on the growth of KG-1 cells. GM-CSF also reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP on HL-60 cells. Inhibition by DH-CAP (50% at 5 x 10(-7) M), nitroso-CAP (NO-CAP) (60% at 5 x 10(-6) M) and NPAP (35% at 10(-5) M) was not affected by either CSF. In addition to their inhibitory effect on cell growth, DH-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) and NO-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) inhibited CSF production by buffy coat cells 50-70% without affecting cell viability. Neither CAP nor NPAP inhibited CSF production. It is suggested that the dual toxic-inhibitory effect of some intestinal metabolites of CAP such as DH-CAP on hematopoietic cell growth on the one hand, and on CSF production on the other, renders them very potent as potential mediators of CAP induced aplastic anemia.

The rats showed an elevated level of blood fibrinogen degradation product content even 30 minutes after injection. Furthermore the rats that were pretreated intravenously with heparin sulfate did not develop MNE, indicating the acute disturbances of blood microcirculation in the intestine. Multiple necrotizing enteritis was developed also by the injection with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) but rarely was observed with even a high dose of recombinant interleukin-1 (rIL-1) or platelet-activating factor (PAF). The supernatant was cytotoxic in vitro to TNF-susceptible LM and many other cells but was less cytotoxic to the TNF-resistant LR line. Partial purification of the supernatant suggested that the supernatant contained a cytokine that has biochemical features of TNF. Furthermore polyclonal anti-TNF antibody could inhibit not only the cytotoxicity in vitro but also MNE development in vivo by this factor. These data strongly indicate that MNE possibly could be caused by a TNF-like cytokine produced by macrophages that are stimulated by the endotoxin. ',\n",

Apart from cancers that arose from these polyps, there were four separate polypoid or flat gastric carcinomas and three other hyperplastic polyps with no signs of malignancy, in this case. The presentation is followed by a detailed discussion focusing on the possible development of carcinoma in gastric hyperplastic polyps in view of the data from the literature. ',\n",
       " '476': 'Treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy by enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly, followed by arthrodesis. Thirty-seven patients who had enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly and stabilization of the spine for cervical spondylotic myelopathy were followed for an average of forty-nine months (range, twenty-eight to seventy months). Myelography and computed tomographic myelography were performed preoperatively on all patients to determine the location and features of the areas of decompression. The canal was enlarged by discectomy; by subtotal corpectomy and removal of the anteromedial parts of the pedicles; or by removal of osteophytes or of the posterior longitudinal ligament, or both. Partial corpectomy and interbody arthrodesis was performed in nine patients; subtotal corpectomy, including removal of the posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in fifteen patients; and subtotal corpectomy, with detachment of the remaining thin posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in thirteen patients. Postoperatively, radiographic examinations, including myelography and computed tomographic myelography, were performed for thirty-six patients and magnetic resonance imaging, for twenty-eight. A satisfactory neurological result was obtained in twenty-nine patients. Atrophy of the spinal cord, as seen on preoperative computed-tomographic myelograms, was predictive of an unsatisfactory result of the decompression, as was weakness of the peroneal muscles. All but one of the thirty-seven patients had improved walking ability at the most recent follow-up examination: seventeen patients improved by 1 point; fourteen, by 2 points; four, by 3 points; and one, by 4 points. The remaining patient reverted to the preoperative status after an initial improvement. The ability to walk at the interim examinations was compared with that at the most recent examination; three patients had continuing improvement, while three others had deterioration. The main cause of deterioration was new spondylotic changes associated with stenosis of the spinal canal, occurring at the level of the disc just cephalad to the fused levels. We concluded that anterior decompression followed by a secure arthrodesis should be an extensive procedure for patients who have cervical spondylotic myelopathy, as determined preoperatively from a myelogram or computed tomographic myelogram. Excision of the vertebral bodies should also be wide and should include the anteromedial parts of the pedicles. The third or fourth cervical vertebra should be included in the arthrodesis prophylactically in patients who have stenosis of the spinal canal when either of these vertebrae is adjacent to the level of fusion.

Vitamin B6 is involved in many biological processes of potential relevance to carcinogenesis and tumor growth, including DNA synthesis and maintenance of immunocompetence, yet very little information exists on B6 nutritional status in childhood leukemia. Using a radioenzymatic assay, the authors measured plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of B6, in 11 newly diagnosed untreated children with leukemia and 11 age-matched controls. The children with leukemia had significantly lower PLP levels than the controls. In 26 additional leukemia patients and 26 additional controls, a high-performance liquid chromatography assay also demonstrated lower plasma PLP levels in childhood leukemia compared with controls. These differences were significant for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). The PLP values did not correlate with indices of leukemia cell burden, but did correlate with reported B6 intake, suggesting that illness-related diet changes are at least partially responsible for the low PLP levels. Before any chemotherapy, overall nutritional status was suboptimal in 53% of ALL cases and 57% of ANLL cases. Newly diagnosed children with leukemia have suboptimal overall nutrition as well as suboptimal vitamin B6 status. \",\n",
       " '478': 'A study of the effects of delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the diurnal variation of arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension using indirect and direct arterial pressure monitoring methods. In order to investigate the effect of delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the diurnal variation of arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension, this study examined 24 h arterial pressure using an indirect or a direct monitoring system. When the effect of twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg was examined using the indirect monitoring system in 12 outpatients, delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressures significantly only at limited points during the day. However, each of the averaged 24 h daytime and nighttime arterial pressures showed significant reductions. The 24 h intraarterial pressure monitoring demonstrated that delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressure at most of the measurement points. The arterial pressure reductions during daytime and nighttime were not significantly different, that is, there was no excessive reduction in nighttime arterial pressure. Heart rate and its variability were virtually unaffected by the delapril treatment in either monitoring study. No adverse reactions were observed in the indirect or direct monitoring studies. Thus, it is concluded that twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg brings about a safe and stable antihypertensive effect, without affecting the diurnal variation of arterial pressure.

       " '479': 'Chronic oral etoposide. Etoposide is an important drug that has been recently incorporated with other agents in the curative treatment of patients with advanced neoplasms, including germ cell tumors, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas (NHL), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Etoposide demonstrates remarkable schedule dependency. A randomized comparison has shown an impressive survival difference for patients with extensive SCLC receiving a 5-day course versus those receiving a 1-day course. Because of these and previous clinical and laboratory data, etoposide is now given intravenously or orally in a 3-day to 5-day schedule. It is generally accepted that approximately 50% of the orally administered drug is absorbed. The authors have initiated several etoposide studies using an extended administration schedule, believing that a prolonged schedule may be superior to the standard 3-day to 5-day schedule. This was initially tested in a Phase I study. Results showed that etoposide (50 mg/m2/d) given over 21 days was feasible and was associated with only moderate toxicity. Several Phase II studies have been completed or are nearing completion, including studies in patients with SCLC, NHL, germ cell tumors, soft tissue sarcoma, renal carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Responses have been seen in all of these groups, particularly in patients with SCLC, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. In these groups we saw responses in patients who were clearly resistant to etoposide plus cisplatin given in a standard schedule or in some patients who were resistant to high-dose etoposide with bone marrow transplantation. Investigators at Indiana University Medical Center who studied oral etoposide in a similar fashion in patients with advanced germ cell tumors and SCLC achieved results similar to those reported here. The authors have initiated a number of combination chemotherapy programs using the chronic oral form of etoposide. These include patients with SCLC, non-small cell lung cancer, and elderly patients with high-grade and intermediate forms of NHL. In addition, chronic intravenous oral etoposide is being used in salvage approaches for patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and recurrent resistant intermediate-grade and high-grade NHL. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data suggest that a 50-mg/m2 oral dose is highly bioavailable (91% to 96%). Therefore, during a prolonged oral course at 50 mg/m2, many patients maintain a minimum plasma concentration of 1 microgram/ml. Further studies of multiple dose or continuous infusion etoposide to maintain a potentially critical plasma level are in progress. Etoposide administered in this way could represent a \"new\" drug because many of its features are different, and its activity spectrum may be broader. ',\n",

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization utilizing a 428 base pair [35S]-labelled cDNA probe from the 3' noncoding region of the PSA gene. Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium. The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2) for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586 +/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens, the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and 588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression. In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic epithelium. \",\n",

The authors used the Sarns centrifugal pump (Sarns 3M, Ann Arbor, MI) as a ventricular assist device (VAD) in 30 patients between May 1985 and February 1990. Sixteen patients were unweanable from cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of surgery; nine were patients who developed cardiogenic shock postoperatively in the intensive care unit. One was a donor organ failure; one had a failed PTCA; and one an acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock preoperatively. Two patients were bridged to cardiac transplantation. Of the 28 nontransplant candidates, 20 (71.4%) were weaned successfully, 14 (50%) were discharged from the hospital, and 13 (46%) are alive from 1 to 46 months postoperatively (mean, 21.1 months). Three patients received right ventricular support alone; all three were weaned, and two (66.7%) were discharged. Ten patients received left ventricular assistance alone. Six (60%) were weaned, and four (40%) were discharged. Two patients received left ventricular support initially but were taken back for right VAD insertion because of right-sided heart failure; one (50%) is alive. Fifteen patients received biventricular support. Eleven (77.3%) were weaned, and eight (53.3%) were discharged. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 73 years, with a mean age for men of 59 years and 50.5 years for women. There were no thromboembolic events. Various clinical parameters were evaluated to determine effect on weanability and survival. These results show survival equivalent to any other VAD at this time. The centrifugal pump is a convenient and effective means of maintaining ventricular support in individuals who are believed to have salvageable myocardium. ',\n",

A prospective randomized study was performed in 46 consecutive patients with refractory congestive heart failure (CHF) due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to compare the hemodynamic responses to 48-hour infusions of amrinone and dobutamine. Both drugs substantially reduced pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, right atrial pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac index. Amrinone caused a greater decrease in right atrial pressure than dobutamine (p less than 0.02) and had a positive chronotropic effect not observed with dobutamine (p less than 0.01). The increase in heart rate produced by amrinone correlated inversely with the changes in right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures, suggesting a baroreceptor response to reduced preload. Dobutamine produced a larger increase in stroke volume index than amrinone (p less than 0.01). Ninety-one percent of patients receiving amrinone and only 65% receiving dobutamine had reduction of greater than or equal to 30% in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (p less than 0.05). Cardiac index increased greater than or equal to 30% in similar numbers of patients given amrinone (74%) and dobutamine (65%). Negative fluid balance was recorded in all patients receiving amrinone and in 78% of patients receiving dobutamine (p less than 0.05). Target hemodynamic criteria were achieved in 83% of patients receiving 10 micrograms/kg/min of amrinone. The effective maintenance dose of dobutamine was extremely variable.

       " '489': 'Role of calcium and the calcium channel in the initiation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation. The cellular events during the initiation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation (VF) are poorly understood. We developed a nonischemic, isolated, perfused rabbit Langendorff preparation in which sustained VF could be induced by alternating current (AC) and which allowed changes in perfusate composition. We also used Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition (10 microM ouabain or K(+)-free perfusate) to induce VF. AC stimulation or Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition always initiated VF. Calcium channel blockade by verapamil or nitrendipine uniformly inhibited the initiation of VF in both models. During Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition, 1) VF was prevented by calcium channel blockade, despite evidence of Ca2+ overload, and 2) abolition of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum-generated cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations by ryanodine or Na+ channel blockade with tetrodotoxin did not prevent VF initiation. Lowering extracellular [Ca2+] to 80 microM uniformly prevented the initiation of VF due to Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition but not that due to AC stimulation. VF maintenance also was studied using 1) reduction in perfusate [Ca2+], 2) blockade of Ca2+ channels, or 3) electrical defibrillation. Decreasing the perfusate [Ca2+] to 80 microM resulted in defibrillation during VF whether induced by AC or Na(+)-K+ pump inhibition. Verapamil or nitrendipine also resulted in defibrillation regardless of the initiation method. Electrical defibrillation was successful only in AC-induced VF. The results demonstrate that VF can be initiated and maintained in a nonischemic rabbit Langendorff preparation. The data suggest that increases in slow channel Ca2+ flux, as opposed to increases in cytosolic Ca2+ per se, were necessary for the initiation and maintenance of VF. The data, however, do not exclude an important role for cytosolic Ca2+ in the modulation of VF. ',\n",

Simultaneously with RHC, transmitral flow velocity profiles were obtained by tpDE, and the ratio of the velocity-time integrals of late diastolic active (A wave) and early diastolic passive inflow into the left ventricle (E wave) was calculated (A/E ratio). Invasively determined pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) ranged from 3 to 36 mm Hg (median 13.35, 5%/95% 6/31 mm Hg). Linear regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the A/E ratio and WP (r = .98, p less than .001, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 0.10). The A/E ratio also correlated with other hemodynamic variables such as cardiac output (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.33), cardiac index (r = -.74, p less than .001, SEE = 0.31), and stroke volume index (r = -.68, p less than .001, SEE = 0.34). The interobserver agreement (derived by intraclass correlation analysis between two examiners) on the A/E ratio was high (r = .95, p less than .001, n = 26).

Although long-term transfusion therapy is at least 90% effective in preventing recurrent strokes after an initial cerebrovascular accident in patients with sickle cell disease, it is unknown how long transfusion therapy should be continued. To address this question, we prospectively discontinued transfusions in 10 patients with sickle cell disease whose median duration of transfusion therapy after an initial stroke was 9 1/2 years (range 5 to 12 years). Before the transfusions were discontinued, patients were examined by cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, neuropsychologic testing, electroencephalography, and a complete neurologic examination. Within 12 months after transfusion therapy was stopped, 5 of 10 patients had had an ischemic event. Three events caused relatively mild deficits in the same areas as those originally affected. Two were associated with massive intracranial hemorrhage, including one on the contralateral side of original involvement. An additional patient died suddenly of unknown causes. Of the four remaining patients, three declined to resume transfusion and are relatively well at greater than or equal to 18 months after therapy was stopped. The studies performed before transfusions were stopped were not predictive of recurrent stroke. The risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accident in this group was significantly greater than the estimated risk of 10% in patients who are receiving long-term transfusion therapy (p = 0.002). This adverse outcome suggests that patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke must receive long-term transfusion indefinitely or a suitable therapeutic alternative must be devised.

Among 31 patients with NHDL, there was agreement between MRI and CT findings in 21 patients; MRI findings were positive and CT findings were negative in 8 patients; and MRI findings were negative and CT findings were positive in 2 patients. The false-negative findings of MRI included a laparotomy-proven mesenteric mass and a 6.6-cm lesion in the spleen, both shown by CT. In 13 evaluable patients with HD, there was agreement between MRI and laparotomy findings in 8 patients; MRI findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in 4 patients; and MRI findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in 1 patient. CT findings agreed with laparotomy findings in nine patients; CT findings were positive and laparotomy findings were negative in one patient: and CT findings were negative and laparotomy findings were positive in three patients. This suggested that MRI, although more sensitive than CT, was less specific with more false-positive findings. The spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) for the spleen was generally higher in patients with HD who had pathologically confirmed splenic involvement, and tended to increase with increasing spleen weight. This study was performed on a prototype 0.15 Tesla (Technicare Inc., Solon, OH) resistive unit at a time when methods and reporting for MRI were still being developed. Although MRI appears to have fewer false-negative findings than CT in evaluating the abdomen of lymphoma patients, the lack of a gastrointestinal contrast agent and specificity of T1 elevations in the spleen would not suggest that MRI could replace CT or laparotomy as a staging technique. \",\n",

In the patient group with eye deviation to the left, mortality was significantly higher (64%, p less than 0.001) than in the group with eye deviation to the right (25%); only two patients of the former group (n = 28) could return home. Compared to the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke, the group with eye deviation to the left did significantly worse, both for mortality alone (p less than 0.001) and for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.001). The group with eye deviation to the right did significantly worse only for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.01).

This morbidity must now be assessed in relation to the benefits of avoiding temporary fecal diversion in restorative proctocolectomy. ',\n",
       " '503': 'Essential fatty acid deficiency ameliorates acute renal dysfunction in the rat after the administration of the aminonucleoside of puromycin. The administration of the aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) to rats causes the nephrotic syndrome that is associated with an acute decline in renal function, and an interstitial infiltrate. We examined whether essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), which inhibits macrophage infiltration in glomerulonephritis, affects PAN-induced renal dysfunction. Both control and EFAD rats developed proteinuria that resolved over 28 d. After PAN administration, there was a prominent infiltration of macrophages in rats fed a normal diet. The infiltrate was prevented by the EFAD diet. The absence of a macrophage interstitial infiltrate was associated with a significantly higher Cin in the EFAD rats than in controls at 7 d (5.21 +/- 1.19 versus 0.39 +/- 0.08, P less than 0.002 ml/min/kg BW). In addition, CPAH fell to less than 10 ml/min/kg BW by day 7 in controls, but remained the same as normal in the EFAD. After administration of PAN to control rats, there was no increase in urinary thromboxane excretion or an increase in glomerular thromboxane production. Furthermore, the effect of EFAD could not be mimicked by the administration of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Irradiation-induced leukopenia in rats on a normal diet markedly improved glomerular filtration and renal blood flow in acutely nephrotic rats. EFAD prevents the interstitial cellular infiltrate and the renal ischemia associated with experimental nephrosis. The recruitment of mononuclear cells into the kidney following PAN directly contributes to the decline in renal function. ',\n",

Gender-specific and race-specific incidence and survival rates of osteogenic sarcoma over a 14-year period are presented for persons aged 0 to 24 years from eight Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. They were no significant gender or racial differences in age at diagnosis. There was no significant gender difference in overall incidence. Although incidence rates were slightly higher in blacks compared with whites, the difference was not significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Females (median, 74 months) survived longer than males (median, 29 months), although this difference weakened after controlling for stage. No racial differences in survival were observed. White females survived the longest (median, 94 months), followed by black females (median, 41 months), black males (median, 34 months), and white males (median, 29 months). This striking difference in survival should be explored more fully. ',\n",

The authors performed 25 fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation procedures in nine patients with rectal strictures. In all cases, the stricture developed after rectal surgery. Four patients underwent ileoanal anastomosis after total colectomy for various conditions; five patients underwent rectosigmoid end-to-end anastomosis after resection of a tumor or as treatment for diverticulitis. Maximal stricture dilatation was attained in 20 instances with a single 15-30-mm balloon. In five procedures, two balloons (20 or 15 mm) were inflated simultaneously (\"kissing balloons\" technique) to dilate the strictures. In five patients, only one dilation procedure was required for effective treatment of the strictures, with no clinical evidence of strictures after follow-up of 1.5-56 months (mean, 29.5 months). In the other four patients, multiple procedures were performed: nine in one patient, five in one patient, and three in two patients. In these patients, no recurrent symptoms developed during follow-up of 1.25-18 months (mean, 8.1 months) after the last dilation. Complicating leaks, infection, or hemorrhage did not occur after any of the procedures. Fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of rectal strictures. ',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To compare a simplified method of measuring extravascular lung water (EVLW) using only a single indicator (EVLW-SI) with the standard double indicator dilution technique (EVLW-DI). DESIGN: Direct comparison of EVLW-SI with EVLW-DI in 18 critically ill patients. SETTING: A general medical ICU in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine men and nine women, ages 19 to 80 yr. Six patients were in shock (four from septic shock), and 11 were in respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: EVLW-DI and cardiac output were measured in triplicate during injection of cold indocyanine green dye. Cardiac output was calculated both from pulmonary artery (COpa) and femoral artery (COfem-di) thermal dilution signals. EVLW-SI and COfem-si were also measured during three additional injections of cold saline using only thermal signals from the pulmonary and femoral arteries. Order of measurements was random. EVLW-SI was measured in ten patients while blood was withdrawn through the femoral catheter and in ten patients without blood drawn through the femoral catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 84 comparisons were made. Although the overall correlations were good (r2 = .86), EVLW-SI systematically overestimated EVLW-DI (p less than .05). This difference was greater when EVLW-SI was measured without blood withdrawal through the femoral catheter. In this subgroup, mean values for EVLW by the two methods were within 20% of one another in only two of ten patients, in contrast to the results in six of eight patients in which blood was withdrawn through the catheter. COfem-si and COfem-di also overestimated COpa. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, neither injection of green dye nor blood withdrawal should be necessary during measurements of EVLW-SI, making it a simpler technique for bedside use than EVLW-DI. However, significant discrepancies exist between the two techniques. Some of this difference is apparently due to technical factors related to catheter design. In any case, we cannot recommend use of the single indicator dilution technique at present to estimate EVLW. ',\n",
       " '508': \"Evaluation of endosonography in TN staging of oesophageal cancer. Strategies for the treatment of cancer of the oesophagus depend on the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis. Resection, the only curative treatment, is confined to early tumour stages. Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment. Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly. Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours. In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement. Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study. The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference. For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test). This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus. \",\n",

Steady-state plasma antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations were measured at intervals throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period in 105 women who underwent 134 pregnancies. Phenytoin (PHT) dosage had to be increased in 85% of pregnancies in which the drug was received, carbamazepine (CBZ) dosage in 70%, and phenobarbital (PB) or methylphenobarbital (MPB) dosage in 85%, in an attempt to prevent or correct a fall in plasma concentrations of the respective drugs as pregnancy progressed. The altered disposition of the AEDs usually began in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy (often before epileptic pregnant women are referred for neurological supervision), and had returned to baseline value within 4 weeks of childbirth in two thirds of the women receiving PHT. The return to the nonpregnant situation appeared to be slower for CBZ, PB, and MPB. In women studied during more than one pregnancy, the changes in AED dosage to plasma concentration ratios tended to be greater in the first than in the subsequent pregnancies. Full seizure control prior to pregnancy was associated with a more favorable outcome for freedom from seizures during pregnancy. However, the plasma level monitoring-dosage adjustment policy produced no marked improvement in overall seizure control in pregnancy. This may have occurred because some patients were seen too late in their pregnancies for the policy to have been applied optimally. ',\n",

The clinical history and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are presented of 7 patients with hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type (HCHWA-D). The diagnosis was based on clinical and genealogical data, was confirmed in 3 patients at autopsy and in 2 others by biopsy. Focal neurological signs, and at least some degree of global cognitive deterioration, were observed in all patients, with unequivocal dementia in 4. MRI showed haemorrhages and areas of gliosis and, to a variable extent, hyperintensity of the white matter in T2-weighted images. Neuropathological examination revealed a large recent haemorrhage together with residual lesions from previous haemorrhages or infarcts in all patients examined. The white matter lesions, present on MRI, turned out to be areas of 'incomplete infarction' with demyelination. It is concluded that (hereditary) amyloid angiopathy can lead to strokes, but also to subcortical ischaemic encephalopathy. Amyloid angiopathy should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of white matter lesions, found on CT or MRI, especially when patients present with a cerebral haemorrhage. The relationship between HCHWA-D and Alzheimer's disease, another disease with cerebral amyloid deposition and diffuse white matter involvement, is discussed. \",\n",

Establishing a diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease can be difficult because Kayser-Fleischer rings may not be present and parameters of copper metabolism, including serum and urinary copper, and serum ceruloplasmin levels are neither specific nor diagnostic. In this study, ratios of both the serum alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase were constructed to evaluate their usefulness in differentiating fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease (n = 6) from other etiologies (n = 43). An analysis of the data showed that cutoff values of less than 2.0 for the alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio and greater than 4.0 for the aspartate transaminase ratio were associated with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease only (P less than 0.001).

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This study compared canine systemic hemodynamics and organ blood flow (radioactive microsphere technique) after resuscitation with 0.8% saline (Na+ 137 mEq/L), 7.2% hypertonic saline (Na+ 1233 mEq/L), 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.8% saline, or 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 7.2% saline, each in a volume approximating 15% of shed blood volume. Twenty-four endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18 to 24 kg) underwent a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock, from time 0 to 30 min into the shock period, followed by fluid resuscitation. Data were collected at baseline, 15 min into the shock period, immediately after fluid infusion, 5 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and at 60-min intervals for 2 hr, (65 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and 125 min after the beginning of resuscitation). The animals received one of four randomly assigned iv resuscitation fluids: saline (54 mL/kg), hypertonic saline (6.0 mL/kg), hydroxyethel starch (6.0 mL/kg) or hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (6.0 mL/kg). RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure increased in all groups after resuscitation. Cardiac output increased with resuscitation in all groups, exceeding baseline in the saline and hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch groups (p less than .05 compared with hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch). Sixty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, cardiac output was significantly (p less than .05) greater in either of the two colloid-containing groups than in the hypertonic saline group. After resuscitation, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch produced minimal improvements in hepatic arterial flow, hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch increased hepatic arterial flow to near baseline levels, and saline markedly increased hepatic arterial flow to levels exceeding baseline (p less than .05, saline vs. hydroxyethyl starch). One hundred twenty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, hepatic arterial flow had decreased in all groups; hepatic arterial flow in the hypertonic saline group had decreased to levels comparable with those during shock. Myocardial, renal, and brain blood flow were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Small-volume resuscitation with the combination of hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch is comparable with much larger volumes of 0.8% saline, and is equal to hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch in the ability to restore and sustain BP and improve organ blood flow after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock.

Dynamic exercise increases the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in mixed lymphocytes by a mechanism that is incompletely understood. In a set of in vivo studies, we have investigated the effects of dynamic exercise on the subset distribution of circulating lymphocytes and on the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in each of these subsets in two groups of patients. In healthy subjects, exercise increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and caused lymphocytosis. Whereas the number of Thelper cells increased only modestly, the number of Tsuppressor/cytotoxic and natural killer cells more than tripled. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors varied among subsets but was not significantly altered by dynamic exercise in any subset except natural killer cells (35% increase, p = 0.0302). In a group of patients with congestive heart failure, dynamic exercise increased plasma norepinephrine but did not alter plasma epinephrine and did not cause significant lymphocytosis. We did not detect any significant alterations of circulating leukocyte subsets or beta-adrenergic receptors in any of these subsets after exercise. A combined analysis of healthy patients and heart failure patients revealed a significant correlation between increases in plasma epinephrine and increases in circulating lymphocytes. We conclude that the exercise-induced increase in beta-adrenergic receptors of mixed lymphocytes is predominantly caused by a redistribution of circulating cell subsets that differ in their beta-adrenergic receptor number. This appears to be mediated by epinephrine rather than norepinephrine. ',\n",

We studied 22 consecutive patients referred to an esophageal diagnostic center for evaluation of noncardiac chest pain or dysphagia having high amplitude esophageal contractions, 14 of whom completed the study. Diltiazem (60-90 mg qid) was compared with placebo, each being administered for 8 wk. Patients were evaluated with esophageal motility pre- and posttreatment periods and with regular symptom assessment throughout each 8-wk treatment. Active diltiazem therapy resulted in significantly lower (p less than 0.05) mean distal esophageal peristaltic pressure (128 +/- 20 mm Hg; +/- SE) than placebo (158 +/- 16 mm Hg). Mean chest pains scores were significantly (p less than 0.05) lower with diltiazem therapy than with placebo. Only nine of the 14 patients fulfilled presently acceptable criteria for diagnosing nutcracker esophagus, and the diltiazem effect was similar, although not significant, because of the smaller sample. Conclusions: In this preliminary study involving 14 patients, the oral calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, appeared to improve noncardiac chest pain associated with strong esophageal contraction, the nutcracker esophagus. These improved symptoms were associated with significant decreases in contraction pressure. ',\n",

Overall mortality was 27%, 22% of 58 patients aged less than 70 years and 33% of 42 patients aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Hypertensive putaminal hematoma showed the highest mortality rate (42%, 10 of 24 cases). Chronic alcoholism and anticoagulant medication influenced the mortality rate unfavourably.

We studied 150 consecutive NCCP patients and 50 age-matched controls who alternately received either 80 micrograms/kg or 10 mg intravenous bolus doses of edrophonium preceded by saline placebo injections. Distal esophageal pressures were measured before and after drug injection in response to ten 5-cc wet swallows. Following 10 mg of edrophonium, 33% of patients and 4% of controls reported chest pain, while 29% of patients and no controls receiving the 80 micrograms/kg dose complained of chest pain.

A significantly greater (P = 0.01) increase in distal contraction duration occurred after 10 mg (74 +/- 12%; +/- SE) compared to 80 micrograms/kg dose (43 +/- 6%). However, individual responses to the two doses overlapped considerably. If a positive test is redefined to include both chest pain and manometric changes that are significantly different from controls, the positivity rate changes drastically; 33% to 9% in the 10-mg group and 30% to 3% in the 80-micrograms/kg group.

The rate of O2 consumption, 2.6 l/min (1.8-3.3) (average from cool and hot conditions), corresponded to 55-77% of their individual maximums. In the cool environment a steady state was reached at 30 min. When the subjects were shifted to the hot room, the core temperature and heart rate started to rise and reached values greater than 39 degrees C and near-maximal values, respectively, at the termination of the exercise. The leg blood flow (thermodilution method), femoral arteriovenous O2 difference, and consequently leg O2 consumption were unchanged in the hot compared with the cool condition. There was no increase in release of lactate and no reduction in glucose and free net fatty acid uptake in the exercising leg in the heat. Furthermore, the rate of glycogen utilization in the gastrocnemius muscle was not elevated in the hot environment. There was a tendency for cardiac output to increase in the heat (mean 15.2 to 18.4 l/min), which may have contributed to the increase in skin circulation, together with a possible further reduction in flow to other vascular beds, because muscle blood flow was not reduced.

To determine the role of chronic ethanol intoxication on the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an ethanol-containing diet for 1 week before intratracheal challenge with type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae and for 10 days after infection. Control rats were fed the same diet except that ethanol was replaced isocalorically with carbohydrate. Ethanol treatment increased pneumococcal bacteremia, levels of capsular polysaccharide antigenemia, and susceptibility to lethal pneumonia. Once dissemination occurred, ethanol-fed rats failed to eliminate pneumococci from the bloodstream. Ethanol-fed rats demonstrated a defect in late pulmonary clearance of pneumococci that was temporally associated with a significantly higher pneumonia severity index. Pneumonia was characterized by an intense polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, severe edema, and a fibrous exudate. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the heightened inflammatory response in the lungs of ethanol-fed rats, suggesting that chronic ethanol intoxication did not impair polymorphonuclear leukocyte recruitment but may alter their antipneumococcal functions.

DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of the results of a health check up in a group of clinically healthy middle aged men in the late 1960s (median year 1968). The subjects were invited to enter into a primary prevention trial for cardiovascular disease in 1974, when they underwent clinical examination for risk factors. The trial was completed in 1979, when the men were re-examined. Follow up was in 1986. SETTING--Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland and second department of medicine, University of Helsinki. SUBJECTS--In all, 3490 men born during 1919-34 participated in a health check up in the late 1960s. In 1974, 1815 of these men who were clinically healthy were entered into a primary prevention trial for cardiovascular disease. On clinical examination 1222 of the men were considered at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Of these, 612 received an intervention and were excluded from the study. A total of 593 men were without risk factors. The study comprised all of the men who did not have an intervention (n = 1203). In 1979, 1120 men were re-examined, and in 1986 945 men attended follow up. There were two groups for analysis: one comprising all subjects and the other comprising only men who were normotensive in 1968 and for whom complete information was available. INTERVENTIONS--By 1979, 103 men were taking antihypertensive drugs, and by 1986, 131 were taking antihypertensive drugs and 12 were taking drugs for hyperglycaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load, blood pressure, and body weight were measured in 1968, 1974, and 1979. In 1986 blood pressure and body weight were recorded. RESULTS--Men who were hypertensive in 1986 had significantly higher blood pressures (p less than 0.0001) and (after adjustment for body mass index and alcohol intake) significantly higher blood glucose concentrations one hour after a glucose load at all examinations than those who were normotensive in 1986. Regression analysis showed that the higher the blood glucose concentration after a glucose load in 1968 the higher the blood pressure during the following years. Those men between the second and third tertiles of blood glucose concentration in 1968 had a significantly higher risk of developing hypertension (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.77) compared with those below the first tertile. CONCLUSION--In this study men who developed hypertension tended to have shown an increased intolerance to glucose up to 18 years before the clinical manifestation of their disorder. Blood glucose concentration one hour after a glucose load was an independent predictor of future hypertension. ',\n",

Radical prostatectomy following radiation therapy has no greater immediate morbidity or mortality compared with radical prostatectomy without prior irradiation and takes only slightly longer to perform. However, there is a marked increased risk of impotence and incontinence. More patients followed for a longer time are needed to assess the benefit of radical prostatectomy on survival of patients who fail radiation therapy. ',\n",
       " '527': 'Estimation of myocardial ischemic injury during ventricular fibrillation with total circulatory arrest using high-energy phosphates and lactate as metabolic markers. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To define the time course of myocardial ischemic injury using high-energy phosphate (HEP) depletion and the cessation of lactate production as metabolic markers. SETTING: Data were collected in a laboratory animal model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Ten immature mixed breed swine weighing 23.2 +/- 3.5 kg. DESIGN: After thoracotomy, transmural myocardial biopsies were taken in vivo during normal sinus rhythm and at designated times during ventricular fibrillation with total circulatory arrest (VF-TCA). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Frozen tissue samples were analyzed for adenine nucleotides, by high-performance liquid chromatography, and lactate by enzymatic assay. At five minutes of VF-TCA, myocardial adenosine triphosphate averaged 50% of control. At 15 minutes of VF-TCA, 89% of animals had myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels above 20% of control and adenylate charge ratio above 0.60. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, all animals had adenosine triphosphate levels below 10% of control and adenylate charge ratio below 0.30. In addition, myocardial lactate levels plateaued after 30 minutes of VF-TCA, indicating the cessation of lactate production. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the myocardium can tolerate VF-TCA for as long as 15 minutes without irreversible injury; however, post-ischemic myocardial dysfunction may occur after as little as five minutes of VF-TCA. With more than 30 minutes of VF-TCA, myocardial injury is likely to be irreversible. ',\n",

In a 3-year prospective study of 643 consecutive laparoscopies for infertility, pelvic pain, or infertility and pain, the pelvic area, the depth of infiltration, and the volume of endometriotic lesions were evaluated. The incidence, area, and volume of subtle lesions decreased with age, whereas for typical lesions these parameters and the depth of infiltration increased with age. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis was strongly associated with pelvic pain, women with pain having larger and deeper lesions. Because deep endometriosis has little emphasis in the revised American Fertility Society classification and after analyzing the diagnoses made in each class, considerations for a simplifying revision with inclusion of deep lesions are suggested. In conclusion, suggestive evidence is presented to support the concept that endometriosis is a progressive disorder, and it is demonstrated that deep endometriosis is strongly associated with pelvic pain.

Clinical correlations were performed on subgroups of 149 patients with low-grade lymphoma (LG) and 205 patients with diffuse lymphoma with a large cell component (DLLC). Correlations were made between clinical outcome and individual recurring cytogenetic aberrations, each of which was noted in greater than 5% of cases belonging to LG NHL and DLLC, and derived measures of karyotypic complexity, comprising modal chromosome number, number of marker chromosomes, and number of translocation breakpoints. No correlations with survival were noted in LG NHL, although median follow-up was only 2 years. Seven patients with t(8;14) LG NHL had an indolent course. Among 104 patients with DLLC and abnormal karyotypes at diagnosis, breaks at 1q21-23 or more than 4 marker chromosomes was associated with a shortened median survival. Using these variables we constructed a proportional hazards model with a good fit to observed data. Breaks at 6q21-25 predicted a decreased probability of achieving remission. Patients with DLLC and breaks at 1q21-23 or 1p32-36 had a shorter duration of complete remission. Of 41 DLLC studied at relapse, the only long-term survivors had t(14;18). \",\n",

DESIGN: Data on patients having colonoscopy collected prospectively according to a set protocol. The size and location of all polyps were noted, and all polyps were biopsied. SETTING: Two university hospitals. PATIENTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between 31 December 1987 and 31 August 1989. RESULTS: Of the 970 patients who met eligibility requirements, 274 (28.3%) had adenomas and 108 (11.1%) had hyperplastic polyps. The proportion of patients with distal hyperplastic polyps and proximal adenomas (31.9%) was similar to the proportion of those without distal hyperplastic polyps (23.0%) (crude odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.77 to 3.06). After adjusting for age and sex, the results were unchanged (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53; CI, 0.82 to 2.88). Patients with distal adenomas, on the other hand, were three times more likely to have proximal adenomas than those without distal adenomas (adjusted odds ratio, 3.42; CI, 1.99 to 5.88). CONCLUSIONS: Distal hyperplastic polyps are not strong predictors of risk for proximal adenomas. Based on the magnitude of the risk difference, we do not believe that finding a hyperplastic polyp during sigmoidoscopy justifies doing a full colonoscopy to search for proximal adenomas. Because rectosigmoid adenomas are associated with proximal adenomas, however, small polyps seen during sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied to determine their type. Colonoscopy should be reserved for patients who are proved to have adenomas. ',\n",

Cyclic antidepressants may cause changes in the electrocardiogram at therapeutic or toxic serum levels. The most serious complications of cyclic antidepressant toxicity are dysrhythmias, hypotension, and seizures. It is predominantly the cardiotoxic effects that cause mortality. Once cardiotoxicity is evident, the treatment of choice is serum alkalinization, preferably by sodium bicarbonate therapy. In order to predict which overdose patients are at high risk for complications, electrocardiographic criteria have been identified as reliable screens. For \"first generation\" tricyclic antidepressants, QRS prolongation (particularly greater than 100 msec) and a terminal 40-ms frontal plane axis greater than 120 degrees are the most sensitive. This article reviews antidepressant pharmacology, electrocardiographic manifestations of antidepressant cardiotoxicity, and approaches to treatment of antidepressant-induced conduction disturbances and dysrhythmias.

The outcome of percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty in this subgroup of patients is unclear. Therefore, 67 patients (group 1) underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty between December 1, 1986 and November 1, 1987 who had a low cardiac index (less than 2.5 liters/min per m2) and a low aortic valve gradient (less than or equal to 40 mm Hg) before the procedure. The results were compared with 200 patients (group 2) who had a low cardiac index but not a low aortic valve gradient (greater than 40 mm Hg) before the procedure and who had similar baseline presenting symptoms. After balloon aortic valvuloplasty, there was a greater decrease in aortic valve gradient in patients in group 2 than in patients in group 1 (mean +/- SD -33.0 +/- 16.7 mm Hg and -14.6 +/- 6.9 mm Hg, respectively; p less than 0.001) although there was no significant difference in improvement in estimated aortic valve area (0.31 +/- 0.21 and 0.31 +/- 0.22 cm2, respectively; p = NS).

To see how common relapsing fever is in Senegal thick blood smears from cases of fever of unknown origin and from randomly selected clinic outpatients from a rural dispensary were examined for Borrelia. The prevalence of Borrelia infections in small mammals was also assessed. Borrelia was seen in smears of 12 (0.9%) of 1340 children. All children who tested positive had complained of acute fever. Prevalence was 0% (0/496), 0.5% (2/417), 1.6% (5/308), and 4.2% (5/119) at ages 0-1, 2-4, 5-9, and 10-14, respectively. 26 other instances of borreliosis were seen in patients from different regions of Senegal. Blood samples from 7 of these patients were inoculated intraperitoneally into white mice; serious infection developed in all mice. Borrelia was seen in thick smears from 65 of 461 wild rodents or insectivores. Six rodents species were infected. From a sample of 93 rodents, 33.3% were infected, as judged by intraperitoneal inoculation of white mice, compared with 14.1% by direct smear examination.

Multivisceral isografts and allografts were transplanted to Lewis rats, and the histopathologic changes were studied in the liver, intestine, and other constituent organs. Rats receiving isografts had indefinite survival with maintenance of weight. With multivisceral allografts (from Brown-Norway donors), the intestinal component was rejected more severely than the companion liver and with about the same severity as when intestinal transplantation was performed alone. Intestinal rejection in either circumstance was a lethal event, causing death in 10 to 12 days. The earliest (by day 4) and most intense cellular rejection was in the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. This was associated with or followed by cryptitis, epithelial cell necrosis, focal abscess formation, mural necrosis, and eventual perforation. Liver allografts transplanted alone or as part of multivisceral grafts also had histopathologic evidence of rejection, but this was self-limiting and spontaneously reversible when the liver was transplanted alone. Thus the Achille's heel of multivisceral grafts is the intestinal component that is not protected by the presence of the liver in the organ complex. Better immunosuppression should permit successful experimental and clinical transplantation of such grafts. \",\n",

A diagnosis of ovarian cancer was made by contributing pathologists on 477 subjects. Agreement between the two groups of pathologists was 97% for primary epithelial ovarian cancer and 89% for primary nonepithelial ovarian malignancies. Agreement on diagnosis of major cellular subtypes of ovarian malignancy ranged between 73% for endometrioid cancer and 100% for clear cell carcinomas.

The results of a light and transmission electron microscopic analysis of an endolymphatic sac (ES) from a patient suffering from episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss are presented. A biopsy of the intraosseous portion of the ES was obtained during a translabyrinthine approach to section the vestibular nerve in the internal acoustic meatus. The material consisted mainly of tubular epithelial structures filled with heavily stained material. Pathologically dilated and degranulated rough endoplasmic reticuli and disaggregation of polyribosomes with accumulation of solitary ribosomes in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum suggested a disturbed epithelial cell protein synthesis. Ultrastructural evidence of an increased merocrine secretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES was noted. This made it possible to analyze the presumed intracellular secretory pathways. An increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and monocytes was observed. Since the inner ear had been subjected to surgical intervention before the vestibular nerve section, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether the patient's symptoms were related to the disturbed protein metabolism and hypersecretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES. The findings support earlier experimental results that indicate that the ES has not only a resorptive function but also a secretory one. \",\n",

Of 128 patients, 77 (60.1%) died of recurrence within 2 years after surgery: 16 (12.5%) from 2 to 5 years and two (1.6%) over 5 years. The rate of death of recurrence within 2 years was higher in patients with T4 or N1 than T1, T2, and T3 or N0 (P less than 0.01). Survivors over 5 years more frequently possessed type II DNA pattern than types III and IV (P less than 0.05).

Survivors from 2 to 5 years were higher in type III than in type IV (P less than 0.05), and recurrence over 5 years was found only in type II. This inclination was more apparent in those with curative resection. In the patients with type II, careful follow-up may be needed over 5 years for late recurrence. However, in those with type IV, no recurrence over 2 years could be regarded as healed because most of their recurrences occur within 2 years.

The sleep/wake patterns of 121 chronically ill, mentally and physically handicapped patients were visually monitored hourly for 14 consecutive days. Four types of sleep/wake patterns were found. In order to investigate how cognitive and physical functions correlated with sleep disorders, patients were classified based on a scale of mental function and the grading of daily activity. The percent of total sleep hours and the sleep rating, showing disturbances in sleep/wake pattern, were evaluated. We found a high degree of individuality in sleep/wake patterns. Sleep disturbance was associated with daily activity as well as with cognitive impairment. This monitoring system provides medical personnel with valuable information for clinical management. ',\n",

One hundred dogs had no treatment before amputation or death. One hundred other dogs were treated with either radiation therapy alone (n = 23), intraarterial (IA) cisplatin alone (n = 16), intravenous (IV) cisplatin alone (n = 6), radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin (n = 47), or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin (n = 8). Eighty-nine of these 100 dogs had their tumors resected 3 weeks after the end of therapy (6 weeks after the initiation of therapy) and replaced with a cortical bone allograft. Dogs with preoperative treatment were evaluated for local tumor control and time to metastasis. The mean percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma was 26.8%. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation only, IA cisplatin only, and IV cisplatin only was 81.6%, 49.1% and 23.8%, respectively. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin was 83.7% and 78.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference between percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma compared with those receiving IV cisplatin, but there was a significant increase in percent tumor necrosis with all other treatments. A mathematic model for the effect of cisplatin and radiation dose was developed using multiple regression analysis. The radiation dose calculated to cause at least 80% tumor necrosis was 42.2 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 47.6 Gy) when radiation was given alone and 28.1 Gy (95% CI, 21.3 to 36.6 Gy) when radiation was combined with IA cisplatin. Areas of viable tumor tended to be most frequent adjacent to the articular cartilage and in the joint capsule. Percent tumor necrosis was strongly predictive for local tumor control; 28 of 32 dogs with greater than 80% tumor necrosis had local control, and only eight of 29 dogs with less than 79% tumor necrosis had local control (P = 0.0047). There was no correlation between percent tumor necrosis and time to metastasis. ',\n",

We report clinical features, surgical management, recurrences, and follow-up study of 12 patients with simple hepatic cyst, 11 patients with polycystic liver disease, and 19 patients with cystadenoma who were surgically treated over a 25-year period. The median age of patients was 48 years, and 37 women and 5 men were in the series. The most common presenting symptom and physical finding were chronic abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The most commonly associated disease was polycystic kidney disease, which was an associated finding in 5 of the 11 patients with polycystic liver disease (45%). The most valuable diagnostic studies in all groups were computed tomography and ultrasonography. The location of the disease was bilobar in patients with polycystic liver disease, with a right lobe predominance in 18% of patients. The right lobe was also predominant in 83% of patients with simple hepatic cyst and 58% of patients with cystadenoma. Of all solitary cystic lesions in the left lobe, 75% of them were cystadenomas. Of the 66 surgical procedures performed, aspiration was associated with a failure rate of 100%; partial excision, a failure rate of 61%; and total excision and liver resection, a failure rate of 0%. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in three patients and was associated with two early deaths. Partial excision relieved symptoms in three patients (43%) with polycystic liver disease. Total excision, enucleation, or liver resection with cyst(s) is the treatment of choice for non-parasitic cystic lesions of the liver. ',\n",

On day 9 of infection, the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125 +/- 19 mg in the control group versus 102 +/- 14 mg in the captopril group (p less than 0.0003). Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5% (2.0% to 7.5%) in the placebo group versus 2.0% (0.0% to 5.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The amount of dystrophic calcification was 5.0% (0.0% to 27.5%) in the placebo group versus 1.3% (0.0% to 20.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The extent of the histopathologic involvement by planimetry was 10.2% in the placebo group versus 5.4% in the captopril group (p = 0.052).

The 83 patients suffering cerebral infarction had significantly higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and significantly lower serum concentrations of triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus than 3 months later. The lipid profiles of the 53 patients suffering lacunar infarction were similar on both occasions, the only significant differences being higher total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. No significant changes were observed among the 35 patients suffering cerebral hemorrhage apart from a significantly higher concentration of high density lipoprotein3-cholesterol less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. Our study, with many patients classified according to stroke subtype, gives results different from those of previous studies with much fewer patients. We conclude that in studies of serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations as risk factors for cerebral infarction, comparing values obtained less than or equal to 48 hours after admission with control values may incorrectly identify certain lipid fractions as risk factors.

The neuropsychological abnormalities found in 9 patients with tumours involving the splenium of the corpus callosum are described. The outstanding features of their cognitive deficits were a severe memory deficit and visual perception impairment in the presence of relatively intact intellect. It is argued that (1) the amnesia is due to damage to the fornix where that structure is closely applied to the splenium and that it is the result of a disconnection between the frontal and temporal lobes, although the possibility that damage to more than one structure, for example, retrosplenial cortex and fornix, cannot be excluded; (2) there is a dual pathway for visual object recognition, one of which passes directly to the dominant hemisphere for semantic analysis and the other via the nondominant hemisphere for prior perceptual analysis. Further, it is postulated that there is a subcortical as well as a callosal route between the hemispheres that is important for visual object recognition. ',\n",

Vagotomy, pyloroplasty and underrunning of the bleeding point was performed in 101 cases with ten deaths (10 per cent), partial (Billroth II) gastrectomy in 81 cases with ten deaths (12 per cent), and vagotomy and antrectomy in 16 cases with one death (6 per cent). A patient was more likely to be treated by partial gastrectomy if a giant ulcer with an internal diameter of greater than or equal to 2 cm was found. The results suggest that while vagotomy and pyloroplasty, combined with a direct attack on the bleeding point or excision of an anterior ulcer is an acceptable standard emergency operation for bleeding duodenal ulcer, gastric resection proved to be a satisfactory alternative procedure and should be considered in the technically difficult case with a very large ulcer. A giant ulcer was present in 37 per cent of cases coming to surgery. ',\n",

IgA nephropathy, the most commonly occurring type of chronic glomerulonephritis in individuals of European and Asian descent, exhibits marked heterogeneity of clinical signs and ultimate prognosis. Based upon their studies of regional clustering of the ancestors of related patients in eastern Kentucky, the authors have postulated the existence of an inherited disease susceptibility for IgA nephropathy. They examined serum concentrations of individual complement proteins and phenotypes for C3, C4A, C4B, and factor B (Bf) for related and unrelated patients with IgA nephropathy from Kentucky and for patients from the Mid-South region of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama. In these populations, they have described partial complement deficiencies or specific phenotypes which may be associated with the disease. Their findings include the following: (1) partial deficiencies for C2, beta 1H (H), properdin (P), or C4 binding protein (C4BP) in four patients with end-stage renal disease, (2) an association between the C3*F allele with IgA nephropathy in the combined group of unrelated patients from Kentucky and the Mid-South, (3) the occurrence of C4B deficiency in two siblings with IgA nephropathy, and (4) an association between C4A deficiency and poor outcome in patients with IgA nephropathy diagnosed as adults. In addition, the related patients differ from the unrelated patients from Kentucky with respect to frequencies of Bf*F and the BfF (FF + FS + F1F + F1S) phenotype, suggestive of immunogenetic difference between these groups. Important functional differences exist between C4A and C4B isotypes and functional differences are also possible based upon C3 or Bf phenotype. ',\n",

This study investigated the effect of physical training on muscle blood flow (BF) in rats with peripheral arterial insufficiency during treadmill running. Bilateral stenosis of the femoral artery of adult rats (300-350 g) was performed to reduce exercise hyperemia in the hindlimb but not limit resting muscle BF. Rats were divided into normal sedentary, acute stenosed (stenosed 3 days before the experiment), stenosed sedentary (limited to cage activity), and stenosed trained (run on a treadmill by a progressively intense program, up to 50-60 min/day, 5 days/wk for 6-8 wk). Hindlimb BF was determined with 85Sr- and 141Ce-labeled microspheres at a low (20 m/min) and high treadmill speed (30-40 m/min depending on ability). Maximal hindlimb BF was reduced to approximately 50% normal in the acute stenosed group. Total hindlimb BF (81 +/- 5 ml.min-1.100 g-1) did not change in stenosed sedentary animals with 6-8 wk of cage activity, but a redistribution of BF occurred within the hindlimb. Two factors contributed to a higher BF to the distal limb muscle of the trained animals. A redistribution BF within the hindlimb occurred in stenosed trained animals; distal limb BF increased to approximately 80% (P less than 0.001) of the proximal tissue. In addition, an increase in total hindlimb BF with training indicates that collateral BF has been enhanced (P less than 0.025). The associated increase in oxygen delivery to the relatively ischemic muscle probably contributed to the markedly improved exercise tolerance evident in the trained animals. ',\n",

       " '572': 'Injuries of the external ear. Ear injuries occur in people of all ages but predominate in active people such as wrestlers, boxers, and bike riders. The types and extent of injury are a function of the force causing the injury. Shearing forces of moderate intensity cause hematoma formation, whereas greater force causes lacerations or even amputation. Sharp objects cause lacerations determined by the force, direction, and point of impact. The high ratio of surface area to mass makes the auricle vulnerable to extremes of temperature. People participating in high-risk activities should wear protective headgear. The goal of treatment is to restore the normal contours while preventing infection. Hematoma results in disfigurement by organization or chondritis. Evacuation and pressure dressings using sterile technique correct the condition. Second-degree burns are treated by regular cleansing and application of topical antimicrobials. Deeper burns require debridement, biologic dressings, or burying the cartilage subcutaneously for later reconstruction. Simple lacerations are closed under aseptic technique using either skin-to-skin sutures only or sutures of the skin combined with intercartilage sutures. Extensive and complex lacerations require meticulous care to match all fragments and prevent infection or loss of tissue. Bare cartilage must be covered with vascularized tissue. The treatment of total amputation is controversial. Some advocate reattachment as a composite graft using intravenous low molecular weight dextrans and heparin as adjuvants. Mladick dermabrades the amputated pinna, reattaches it with sutures, and then slips it into a pocket of elevated postauricular skin for 2 weeks. Others urge microvascular reanastomosis of the small nutrient vessels. Brent and Byrd separate the cartilage from its overlying skin and envelope it first with vascularized temporoparietal fascia and then a split-thickness skin graft. Chondritis is the most feared complication of injury or surgery of the pinna. It is an aggressive process, and prompt removal of pus and necrotic cartilage is required. Exteriorization and removal of all cartilage is effective but disfiguring. Removal of only affected cartilage and constant irrigation with antibiotic solutions is effective but requires prolonged hospitalization. Iontophoresis of antibiotics into the auricle may be effective and conserve tissue. Traumatic deformities are corrected with composite grafts from the opposite ear, costal cartilage, and local pedicled flaps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). ',\n",

Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules. Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect. \",\n",

The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of xamoterol in the human myocardium. In the presence of forskolin or milrinone, xamoterol increased isometric force of contraction, contraction velocity, and relaxation velocity in isolated, electrically driven preparations from human myocardium, but had no effect alone. There was no difference in the effect of xamoterol between right atrial myocardium and left ventricular myocardium from nonfailing (NF), moderately failing (NYHA II-III), and severely failing (NYHA IV) human hearts. The positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of isoprenaline were reduced depending on the severity of heart failure in left ventricular myocardium (i.e., NF greater than NYHA II-III greater than NYHA IV). In the presence of norepinephrine, xamoterol produced negative inotropic effects similar to those of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists pindolol and propranolol. Xamoterol alone had no effects on force of contraction, whereas pindolol and propranolol markedly reduced contractile force. In NYHA class IV, isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase about twofold but xamoterol, like pindolol or propranolol, had no effect. Experiments with the beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists CGP 207.12A and ICI 118.551, respectively, showed that the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of xamoterol were mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. Consistently, xamoterol had a selectivity of 13.8 at beta 1-adrenoceptors as measured in radioligand binding experiments. It is concluded that xamoterol acts as a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a selectivity of 13.8 in human ventricular myocardium. The compound has an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as it produces beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the presence of forskolin. The beneficial effects of xamoterol in patients with heart failure could be due to prevention of the detrimental effects of norepinephrine such as beta 1-adrenoceptor downregulation of an increase of Gi (inhibitory guanine-nucleotide binding protein).

To validate the geographic pattern shown by the Medicare data, hospitalization was compared with mortality from inflammatory bowel disease among different states. Mortality and hospitalization statistics both suggested that the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease was determined by environmental factors that had a marked geographic variation within the United States. Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in northern parts of the United States than in southern and in urban more than rural parts.

Results of one third of the GH tests were defined as normal (GH peak response, greater than 15 mU/L) within the first 5 years, in comparison with 16% after 5 years. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that dose (p = 0.007) and time from irradiation (p = 0.03), but not age at therapy, had a significant influence on peak GH responses. The late incidence of GH deficiency was similar over the whole dose range (4 of 26 GH test results normal for less than 30 Gy and 4 of 25 normal for greater than or equal to 30 Gy after 5 years), but the speed of onset over the first years was dependent on dose. We conclude that the requirement for GH replacement therapy and the timing of its introduction will be influenced by the dose of irradiation received by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. ',\n",

Plasma calcium greater than 2.55 mmol/l was found in 462 patients. Repeat samples were received from 302 of these and hypercalcaemia was confirmed in 183. The main causes of hypercalcaemia were malignancy (72.1 per cent), tuberculosis (6.0 per cent), and primary hyperparathyroidism (5.5 per cent). In the malignant hypercalcaemia group, carcinoma of lung was the most common (31.8 per cent) and carcinoma of breast was uncommon (3.0 per cent). Secondary deposits in bone were detected in 35 of the 122 solid tumours. In order to identify the mechanism of hypercalcaemia the contributions of renal tubular reabsorption and increased bone resorption to the plasma calcium concentration were calculated. Increased tubular reabsorption was the main contributor to hypercalcaemia in primary hyperparathyroidism and carcinoma of liver (none of whom had bony metastases) and it contributed significantly to hypercalcaemia in carcinoma of lung without bony metastases and carcinoma of oesophagus.

Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with ventricular fibrillation (Group II). Results of signal-averaged ECG analysis were abnormal in 92% of patients with ventricular tachycardia and 85% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS). Abnormal spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90% of patients with ischemic and from 86% of patients with nonischemic heart disease (p = NS). In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly between the two patient groups. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 91% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared with only 46% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.0001). Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81% of patients with ischemic heart disease compared with only 50% of those with nonischemic heart disease (p less than 0.02). Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with ventricular fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose arrhythmia was not inducible by programmed stimulation.

In contrast, the endothelium-independent vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside remained fully active in group 3W-H. The pressor response to 300 pM endothelin was greater in group 3W-H than in controls (6.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) but was not potentiated by the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) antagonists: hydroquinone (10(-4) M); methylene blue (10(-4) M); and pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M) as it was in controls.

       " '586': 'Plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is related to liver function but not to portal-systemic shunting, systemic vascular resistance, or urinary sodium excretion. We tested the hypothesis that increased plasma glucagon concentration resulting from portal-systemic shunting or liver dysfunction causes arterial vasodilation and thereby stimulates sodium retention in cirrhosis. Twenty-seven studies were performed in patients with alcoholic liver disease, 11 of whom had ascites. Liver function was quantitated as the elimination rate of antipyrine, caffeine, and stable isotopes of cholic acid administered both orally (2,2,4,4-2H) and intravenously (24-13C). Portal-systemic shunt fraction was calculated as the ratio of the intravenous and oral clearances of the isotopes of cholic acid. Cardiac output was measured by using Doppler echocardiography. Plasma glucagon concentration was increased in patients with ascites when compared with that in patients without ascites (474 +/- 180 pg/ml vs 245 +/- 120 pg/ml, p = 0.0007) but was unrelated to urinary sodium excretion, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.48, 0.35, -0.13, 0.18, and 0.22, respectively). Plasma glucagon concentration correlated with the half-lives of all model compounds (r = 0.58, p = 0.002; r = 0.62, p = 0.0008; r = 0.62, p = 0.001; and r = 0.64, p = 0.0005; for caffeine, antipyrine, oral and intravenous cholic acid, respectively) but not with shunt fraction (r = 0.14). Increased plasma glucagon concentration in cirrhosis is probably a result of diminished hepatic clearance. However, increased plasma concentration of glucagon does not appear to cause a hyperdynamic circulatory state or sodium retention. ',\n",

In order to evaluate the effects of one-year antihypertensive treatment on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, 65 patients whose diastolic blood pressure was in the range 95-120 mmHg were randomly allocated to groups that received either hydrochlorothiazide or metoprolol, or both drugs when the response to one of them was insufficient to control blood pressure. Blood pressure was effectively reduced in all groups. Patients on hydrochlorothiazide showed a significant increase (P less than 0.01) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 3 months of treatment. A significant increase in triglycerides was observed after 6 and 12 months, together with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 12 months (P less than 0.05) of treatment in patients on metoprolol. In patients treated with both hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol, total cholesterol increased after 3 (P less than 0.001) and 6 months (P less than 0.05), triglycerides increased after 6 (P less than 0.01) and 12 months (P less than 0.01), and LDL-C increased after 3 (P less than 0.05), 6 (P less than 0.001) and 12 months (P less than 0.01) of treatment, respectively. In 61% of the patients, three or more lipid parameters were affected during the study period. We conclude that long-term antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and particularly with both drugs, can induce lipid effects that deserve recognition, because in some cases these might counteract the possible benefit of a reduction in blood pressure on the prevention of coronary heart disease.

Tumors stained uniformly for keratins and, on occasion, focally for vimentin. Tumors were nonreactive with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein and, with few exceptions, to muscle-specific actins and S-100 protein. Clear cell and papillary histologic variants were seen as potential diagnostic pitfalls.

Preoperative diagnostic studies included magnetic resonance imaging in all patients, inferior venacavography in 16 and computerized tomography scanning in 15. All patients underwent an operation in which the presence and extent of the vena caval thrombus were confirmed. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately delineated the presence and extent of the thrombus in all 20 patients (100%). Venacavography was accurate in 15 patients (94%) but 8 (50%) required a retrograde and antegrade study. Computerized tomography scanning demonstrated the presence of a tumor thrombus in all 15 patients but accurately delineated the cephalad extent of the thrombus in only 5 (33%). In patients with vena caval tumor thrombi magnetic resonance imaging can provide accurate information regarding the extent of vena caval involvement while avoiding the need for an invasive contrast imaging study.

Based on observations of changes in muscle function associated with aging, and the exacerbation of these changes with frailty, a program of muscle strengthening has been developed to correct specific defects in muscles. This pilot study was undertaken on 18 functionally impaired nursing home residents (age range 60 to 90 years) with markedly deteriorated muscle function (50%) secondary to age, disuse, and multiple chronic illnesses. Fourteen of the subjects completed the six-week program without adverse effects. In 75% of the patients, there was improved muscle function, with endurance, strength, and speed increasing 35%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. After the program, many subjects increased their spontaneous activity and decreased their dependency. The improvements were still evident four months after rehabilitation.

Hemodynamic events and structural vascular changes of the gastric mucosa in cirrhotics have caught the attention of investigators in the recent past, but as yet it is not known whether therapeutic interruption of variceal blood flow at gastroesophageal level alters such portal hypertensive mucosal features. The newly developed endoscopic laser-Doppler technique was used to assess whether variceal eradication by means of endoscopic sclerotherapy influences the gastric mucosal congestion in portal hypertension patients. Gastric mucosal blood flow was determined at ten defined sites of the stomach, before the first session of sclerotherapy and after complete variceal eradication had been achieved in 15 patients. A statistically significant decrease (P less than 0.01 to 0.05) in microcirculation was found at the gastric antrum and corpus, an increase at the pylorus (P less than 0.05), but no change in the fundic area.

       " '593': 'Erythropoietin receptors induced by dimethyl sulfoxide exhibit positive cooperativity associated with an amplified biologic response. Erythropoietin triggers the differentiation of erythrocyte progenitors by binding to receptors on their plasma membrane. We report here that pretreatment of erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cells with chemical inducers resulted in a striking increase in erythropoietin-specific hemoglobinization. This amplification of the erythropoietin biologic response was accompanied by the induction of a new population of high-density receptors (approximately 20,000 per cell) exhibiting marked positive cooperativity. Erythropoietin binding to new receptors displayed a convex upward Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 6.75. Measurement of erythropoietin receptor mRNA demonstrated an initial decrease in receptor transcript followed by an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase after 24-48 hr. This increase in receptor message does not appear to account for the magnitude of the receptor up-regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide. We propose that this positive cooperativity reflects the interaction (clustering) of receptors, presumably through the formation of homooligomers or heterooligomers, and that this receptor interaction may amplify the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway.

The immediate pathophysiological process responsible for sudden cardiac death is a lethal arrhythmia, usually ventricular fibrillation. Although significant coronary atherosclerosis is present in most cases of naturally occurring sudden death, available evidence indicates that several mechanisms can be operative in the pathogenesis of the fatal event. These are (1) acute myocardial infarction in a minority of cases; (2) myocardial ischemia, without infarction, which is initiated either by (a) an exertion-induced increase in myocardial oxygen demand or (b) an acute coronary event often involving plaque degeneration and platelet aggregation; and (3) a primary arrhythmia, usually resulting from altered electrical conduction in the setting of a previous myocardial infarction.

Eleven IRP were placed in the ascending aorta, two in the transverse arch, and 11 in the descending aorta. Pathology included acute aortic dissection in four patients, chronic dissection in four, and aortic aneurysm in 16. There were eight hospital deaths (35%). Causes of death included acute cardiac failure in seven patients, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in one. IRP complications requiring revision included right coronary artery occlusion in three of 11 patients (27%) with an IRP in the ascending aorta. Graft revision was also required in three of 11 IRP implanted in the descending aorta (27%), due to graft occlusion in one and graft stenosis in two. Of the six patients with IRP complications, there were three hospital deaths (50%). All 15 hospital survivors were followed for a mean of 68.5 months, range 5-112 months. There were four late deaths (26.7%). Causes of late death included hemoptysis in one, cardiomyopathy in one, and aortic redissection and rupture in two. We conclude that patients undergoing repair of aortic pathology with IRP have an important risk of early phase events, as technical problems can occur due to malposition and slippage of the securing rings.

In the initial series of 198 patients treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, a review of presenting chest radiographs available on 192 of these patients showed 49 patients with mediastinal masses greater than one third the greatest posteroanterior chest diameter. Five patients had stage IIB disease, and 44 had stage III or IV disease. Thirty-five (71%) patients achieved a complete remission with MOPP chemotherapy. Fourteen (40%) of the complete responders relapsed, but four of these achieved durable remissions in response to subsequent therapy. Thirty (61%) patients have died (14 induction failures, nine relapsed patients, seven complete responders in remission). Thus, with a median follow-up of 20 years (range, 15 to 23), the overall survival for the group is 39%, and the disease-free survival for the complete responders is 60%. A subset of 10 patients received mantle radiation therapy after maximal response to MOPP. One of these patients failed to achieve complete remission, but among the nine complete responders only one has relapsed. In contrast, 13 of 26 (50%) patients achieving a complete response to MOPP alone have relapsed (P2 = .0536). Although MOPP alone was not prospectively compared with MOPP plus radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease in this series, the retrospective analysis shows a nearly significant difference in disease-free survival favoring combined modality treatment. The difference in tumor mortality between MOPP-treated (44%) and combined modality-treated patients (80%) was also nearly significant (P2 = .055). However, overall survival differences between patients treated with MOPP alone and those treated with combined modality therapy were not significantly different (P2 = 0.23) because of the mortality related to late complications of combined modality treatment. \",\n",

Acute cerebral ischemia increases the generation of free radicals, causing cell damage, and theoretically may decrease the activity of the scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase. To investigate the role of superoxide dismutase in cerebral ischemia, we used a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. In this model an infarct is produced in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortices, extending into the lateral basal ganglia. We measured superoxide dismutase activity by using the xanthine oxidase cytochrome c reduction assay in these areas of rat brains. Tissue samples were analyzed 20 minutes, 2, 6, or 24 hours, or 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion and 2 or 24 hours or 7 days after sham operation (n = 8-10 at each time). There was no significant change in superoxide dismutase activity relative to control values in any brain area at any time up to 24 hours after surgery. However, 7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion a significant decline in superoxide dismutase activity, to 55%-68% (p less than 0.05) of that in unoperated controls, was observed in all brain areas. Our results do not support an important role for changes in the activity of endogenous superoxide dismutase during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. However, the decrease in superoxide dismutase activity 7 days after ischemia could indicate ongoing additional damage to peri-infarct tissue. ',\n",

Out of a personal series of 124 acoustic neurinomas treated over the past 35 years, the senior author has undertaken a radical intracapsular approach in 12 patients with large tumors (greater than 3 cm in diameter). Surgical indications for intracapsular removal included advanced age (five cases), the patient's wish to avoid any risk of facial paralysis (six cases), contralateral facial palsy (one case), and contralateral deafness (one case). Eleven of these 12 patients were available for follow-up review. Tumor recurrence developed in two patients (18%) at 2 and 3 years postoperatively; there were no late recurrences. Four patients died of unrelated causes, 10 to 19 years after surgery. The remaining five patients have survived a mean of 12 years since surgery without recurrence (range 3 to 22 years).

Irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for the entry complaints. This determination was made by two other board-certified gastroenterologists after patients had been in the study for 9 months. These raters were independent of the study and rated the transcripts of patients' clinic visits, all other available clinical data from this and other clinics, all laboratory data obtained during the 9-month study period, and the results of a 9-month telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the study population had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome for this study. A similar proportion and type of organic disease and irritable bowel syndrome were experienced by men and women. For the total sample of 97 subjects, the correlation of the Manning criteria with irritable bowel syndrome was 0.22 (P less than 0.01). In the 61 women, correlation between the Manning criteria and irritable bowel syndrome was significant (r = 0.47; P less than 0.01). In the 36 men, however, the correlation was in the opposite direction, although it was not significant (r = -0.16).

Most strictures occur as a result of injury to the bile duct during cholecystectomy. In addition, strictures can occur at the site of previous biliary anastomoses for reconstruction of the biliary tree. Most patients with benign bile duct strictures present soon after their initial operation; however, in some cases, presentation is delayed for years. Cholangiography is essential for defining the anatomy of the biliary tree prior to management. In many cases, nonoperative biliary drainage is useful to treat sepsis and biliary fistulas.

To improve the localization of stereotactic targets, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from the thalamus and subthalamic area using a specially designed semimicroelectrode in 61 patients and a conventional \"macroelectrode\" in 17 patients. By means of the semimicroelectrode, median nerve stimulation evoked two distinct SEPs, consisting of a diphasic wave with a huge positivity restricted to the nucleus ventrocaudalis (Vc) and a triphasic wave of lower amplitude with a major negativity in the ventral part of the nucleus ventrointermedius (Vim) and nucleus ventrooralis posterior (Vop) as well as the subthalamic lemniscal pathway. The Vim-Vc junction could thus be clearly delineated by an abrupt transition of SEPs from one type to the other with a precision of 1 mm. The parvicellular part of the Vc (Vcpc), situated in its basal region, was distinguishable from the Vc proper by a significant reduction of the positivity elicited by stimulation of the median nerve and by a rapid growth of a diphasic SEPs to stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve. In the other thalamic nuclei, stimulation of the median nerve elicited triphasic SEPs of a very small amplitude, suggesting a volume conduction current from the lemniscal pathway. With the macroelectrode, the positivity in the Vc was sensitive to electrode manipulation and the thalamic nuclei could not be distinctly outlined. SEP monitoring using the semimicroelectrode significantly improved the precision of target localization, which allowed minimizing of the volume of the therapeutic lesion without losing surgical effectiveness, while avoiding complications associated with increased penetration of the coagulating electrode. It is suggested that recording serial thalamic SEPs with the semimicroelectrode is a practical method to refine stereotactic targets in the thalamus. ',\n",

To determine the effect of data compression on diagnostic accuracy, observer tests were performed with 60 digitized chest radiographs (2,048 x 2,048 matrix, 1,024 shades of gray) containing subtle examples of pneumothorax, interstitial infiltrate, nodules, and bone lesions. Radiographs with no compression, with 25:1 compression, and with 50:1 compression ratios were presented in randomized order to 12 radiologists.

We report a case of multiple duodenal ulcers with gastric hypersecretion due to a nongastrin secretagogue produced by a malignant tumor of the pancreas in a 78-year-old man. The case resembled a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with high acid output (basal acid output 27, sham meal-stimulated 37, maximum acid output 47 mEq/h), but with fasting gastrin 43 pg/ml, nonresponsive to secretin. As in ZES, pepsin output was comparatively low, and secretion was inhibitable by atropine (50% inhibited by 1 microM). The tumor removed at surgery contained less than 1 ng gastrin per gram, but was many times more potent than pentagastrin in stimulating acid from a lumen-perfused rat stomach. The tumor also contained cholecystokinin (CCK-8 and CCK-33), motilin, insulin, and somatostatin, which were also present in adjacent normal pancreas; in addition, the tumor contained pancreatic polypeptide and pancreatic cancer-associated antigen. This case represents a rare syndrome due to an as yet undefined peptide secreted by a (frequently malignant) pancreatic endocrine tumor and masquerading as ZES.

A review of the case histories for 11 individuals indicates that affected males have highly variable genital and nongenital phenotypes. Physical findings may be clearly apparent or nonexistent. With the exception of external genitalia, the basis for this variability is unknown. It may be related to differences in Y chromatin expression as the result of variable inactivation of the X chromosomes, or to the existence of minor deletions or point mutations secondary to an exchange of genetic material.

Isovolumic left ventricular developed pressure fell by more than 50% within 30 seconds of the onset of total global ischemia and reached zero by 5 minutes. Monophasic action potential recordings revealed no decrease in excitability during this period. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra obtained at 30-second resolution showed no significant changes in inorganic phosphate or phosphocreatine during the first 30 seconds of ischemia. Intracellular pH (pHi) and ATP changed even more slowly; therefore, none of these metabolites could account for the rapid fall in force. To gauge the contribution of intravascular pressure, we compared ordinary aortic flow occlusion with tissue-level ischemia induced by massive coronary microembolization at the level of the precapillary arterioles. Functional depression developed significantly more slowly in the microembolized hearts, despite accumulation of inorganic phosphate and protons comparable with that in ordinary ischemia. After microembolization, the time course of functional depression reflected much more closely the concomitant inorganic phosphate and pHi changes. Thus, our results provide novel evidence supporting the importance of vascular collapse in the mechanism of early ischemic contractile failure. ',\n",

The effect of hypothyroidism on non-specific bronchial reactivity was studied in 11 patients without pulmonary disease (mean age 40 (SD 13) years) who had had a total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer 41 (36) months before the study. All patients when mildly hyperthyroid while having long term thyroxine replacement treatment and once when hypothyroid two weeks after stopping triiodothyronine for the purpose of screening for metastases. Bronchial reactivity was assessed by measuring specific airways conductance (sGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled carbachol (45-1260 micrograms). The dose producing a 35% decrease in sGaw (PD35) was determined from the cumulative log dose-response curve by linear regression analysis. Mean baseline sGaw values were similar when the patients were hypothyroid and when they were hyperthyroid (1.35 (0.36) and 1.41 (0.56) s-1 kPa-1). The interstudy coefficients of variation of baseline sGaw were higher in the thyroid patients than in a euthyroid control group (14% versus 8%). Geometric mean PD35 was lower when the patients were hypothyroid (97 micrograms) than when they were mildly hyperthyroid (192 micrograms). It is concluded that acute hypothyroidism increases non-specific bronchial reactivity in nonasthmatic subjects. ',\n",

To investigate whether early changes in the transformation of normal ovarian epithelial cells into tumor cells can be detected with monoclonal antibodies, a comparative immunohistochemical study was performed on normal human ovarian mesothelial cells, cystomas, cystadenomas, ovarian carcinomas, as well as granulosa cell tumor. Using monoclonal antibodies against different keratin subtypes, it was shown that mesothelial cells, ovarian cysts, cystadenomas, and carcinomas all reacted positively with broad-spectrum anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as with MAbs to keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19. Keratins 4 and 13 were not found in mesothelial cells, but positive groups of cells were identified in several cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas. While mesothelial cells did not react with the pan-epithelial marker BW495/36, invaginating metaplastic mesothelial cells, inclusion cysts, cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas showed an increasing reactivity with BW495/36, with an increasing degree of malignancy. The reactivity of MAbs against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OV-TL 3, OC 125, MOv 18, and OV-TL 10) was limited to weak staining reaction in some mesothelial cells but were found to be positive on more than 50% of the ovarian cystadenomas and more than 90% of the ovarian carcinomas. Thecal and granulosa cells of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles all reacted positively with antibodies to the broad-spectrum keratins OV-TL 12/5 and RCK 102, and to keratins 8 and 18, but not with keratins 4, 7, 13, and 19. These keratins decreased or disappeared in granulosa cells of mature follicles (Graafian follicles), whereas granulosa cell tumors did not react with anti-keratin antibodies. The reactivity of BW 495/36 was negative or limited to traces in some granulosa cells. Ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were not expressed in granulosa cells or granulosa cell tumors. The data indicate that mesothelial cells undergoing metaplastic changes finally resulting in ovarian cystadenomas (and carcinomas) initiate the synthesis of a 200-kd glycoprotein recognized by MAb (BW 495/36), the production of ovarian carcinoma associated antigens, in addition to focal production of keratin 4 and/or 13, as seen in several samples. The granulosa cell tumors decrease or switch off their keratin production and remain negative for the 200-kd glycoprotein and the ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens. ',\n",

       " '618': \"Calculated risk of chromosomal abnormalities in twin gestations. Genetic counseling concerning the risks of chromosomal abnormalities in twin gestations can be difficult; the risk of amniocentesis is weighed against that of chromosomal abnormalities in either one or both of the twins. Because most twins are dizygotic (each with a risk a priori of aneuploidy), the chance that one of the fetuses is affected is greater than would be expected for a singleton. Only three possibilities would result in either one or both twin's being affected: 1) dizygotic twins with one fetus affected, 2) dizygotic twins with both fetuses affected, and 3) monozygotic twins with both fetuses affected. Using existing tables of estimated risks of chromosomal abnormalities in singleton gestations and mathematically derived formulas, we created tables defining the age-related risks of chromosomal abnormalities in twin gestations. According to these tables, a patient at 33 years of age with a twin gestation has a risk of Down syndrome in at least one of her twins equivalent to that of a 35-year-old with a singleton. Prenatal genetic testing should be considered for women with twins at a younger age than the traditional 35. \",\n",

Three hemophilia B patients with anti-factor IX antibodies who had no detectable gross deletion of the factor IX gene by Southern blotting analysis were investigated at the molecular level. All eight exons, accompanied by their splicing junction sites and presumptive promoter regions of the factor IX gene in these patients (total 5.5 kb in length) were amplified with the use of the polymerase chain reaction, followed by complete nucleotide sequence analysis. Three different types of novel single base substitutions and a 2 base-pair nucleotide deletion were identified. Patient HB-5 had two point mutations in his factor IX gene. One was located at the promoter region at nucleotide -793 and the other (C-to-T transition) was found in exon VI of the gene changing Gln-191 to a stop codon. Patient HB-6 had a point mutation (G-to-A) in the splice acceptor site, which interrupted the normal splicing of the last intron G. A small two-nucleotide deletion in exon III was detected in patient HB-7 and yielded frameshifted amino acids and terminated by a stop codon. These resuslts suggest that not only the gross gene deletion of factor IX gene but also the point mutations or small nucleotide deletion that may cause the interruption of coding informations for mature protein synthesis is predisposed to development of anti-factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia B.

In paired experiments, we studied the effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on the acute pulmonary injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolization in 19 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. We compared the effect of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg intravenous bolus) given before embolization, early (1 H) in the course of embolization, late (3 h) in the course of embolization, or after embolization (at the beginning of the recovery period). We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and lymph dynamics. In six sheep we also fixed lung tissue for semiquantitative histology, and in some we measured leukocyte concentrations in blood and in pulmonary lymph. Methylprednisolone did not significantly affect pulmonary hemodynamics but it largely prevented lung injury when it was given before embolization. It also lessened the degree of lung injury when it was given during embolization, although this effect became less marked as treatment was delayed. Methylprednisolone had no effect on lung injury when given after embolization was completed (4 h). We found fewer leukocytes attached to air emboli and fewer endothelial cell gaps in the lungs of sheep given methylprednisolone as prophylaxis. Leukocyte counts were lower in lung lymph and higher in the circulating blood of methylprednisolone-treated sheep. We conclude that methylprednisolone has a preventive effect on air embolism lung injury, such that its effect is greater when given earlier during the development of injury. ',\n",

Using Halstead-Reitan Battery data obtained from 245 schizophrenic patients, multiple regression analyses were performed using age, education, and length of hospitalization as independent variables and various summary test indices as dependent variables. These analyses showed that there was not a statistically significant change in percentage of explained variance when length of hospitalization was entered into the multiple regression equations.

Inadequate tissue oxygenation may occur in critically ill patients with sepsis despite an apparently adequate O2 transport (QO2), and this may contribute to the development of an O2 debt and also to multiple organ failure. It has been shown that increasing QO2 by infusing a vasodilator may reveal this O2 debt in septic patients. To investigate whether the site of action of vasodilators may be of importance in unmasking such an O2 debt, we administered prostacyclin, a prostaglandin with a preferential effect on the microcirculation, and phentolamine, an arteriolar vasodilator, in 11 patients studied during the first 48 hours after the onset of sepsis, and compared their effect on whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) and skin microvascular blood flow. The results demonstrated that increasing QO2 by prostacyclin but not by phentolamine significantly increases VO2 in critically ill patients with sepsis. The site of action of vasodilators may therefore play an important role in their ability to unmask an O2 debt. ',\n",

Benign bone lesions in children are often so large in size that there is not an adequate amount of bone available for an autograft to fill the resultant cavity after surgical curettage. This study compared autografts and allografts with respect to the time required and the success of graft incorporation. Fifty-four patients with 61 lesions were studied. Lesions were classified as small volume (less than 60 cc) or large volume (more than 60 cc) and were separated into four groups: small-volume autograft, large-volume autograft, small-volume allograft, and large-volume allograft. Allografts appeared comparable to autografts when small-volume lesions were treated. The healing time was slightly longer for allografts with an average period of 21 months versus 27 months for autografts. Autografts were superior to allografts in rate and completeness of healing for solitary large lesions. This increased efficacy presumes a somewhat older child in which an adequate amount of bone is available for an autograft. A young child with multicentric or polyostotic lesions can still achieve successful incorporation with allografts. In this study, 38% healed completely and 29% healed partially. Allografts have a distinct place in the treatment of benign bone lesions in children. ',\n",
       " '625': 'A paradigm for restenosis based on cell biology: clues for the development of new preventive therapies. Angioplasty causes substantial injury to the coronary artery intima and media that is unrecognizable by angiography. On the basis of a substantial body of research in oncology and wound healing, it is hypothesized that restenosis is a manifestation of the general wound healing response expressed specifically in vascular tissue. The temporal response to injury occurs in three characteristic phases: inflammation, granulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. The specific expression of these phases in the coronary artery leads to intimal hyperplasia at 1 to 4 months. The major milestones in the temporal sequence of restenosis are platelet aggregation, inflammatory cell infiltration, release of growth factors, medial smooth muscle cell modulation and proliferation, proteoglycan deposition and extracellular matrix remodeling. Each step has potential inhibitors that could be used for preventive therapy. Resolution of restenosis, however, probably requires both creation of the largest possible residual lumen and substantial inhibition of intimal hyperplasia. ',\n",
       " '626': 'Comparison of ventricular arrhythmia induction with use of an indwelling electrode catheter and a newly inserted catheter. Two methods of serial electrophysiologic testing are in widespread use. Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study and a new catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test. An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing. Little is known about differences between these two methods with respect to the likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications. To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an indwelling catheter, a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients. Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an indwelling catheter, a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter. Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters. No differences were found between the indwelling and new catheter tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion. Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the indwelling catheter. Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the indwelling catheter (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all). There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications. ',\n",

Distribution according to the TNM system 1978 International Union Against Cancer (UICC) was the following: 22 T1 lesions, 47 T2 lesions, 64 T3 lesions, and 33 T4 lesions. Regional nodes were not palpable in 50 cases, 35 had N1 nodes, 12 had N2 nodes, and 69 had N3 nodes. All patients received external beam radiation. The 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates for all patients were, respectively, 45%, 37%, and 27%. Local control was significantly related to the initial status of the primary, to the tumor regression at the end of the radiation therapy, and to the histologic differentiation. The 2-year local control was 96% for T1 lesions, 57% for T2 lesions, 45% for T3 lesions, and 23% for T4 lesions. Local control was 70% if the tumor regression was complete at the end of the treatment and 27% if the tumor regression was partial. No significant differences were found in primary local control with respect to degree of infiltration, age, and dose of radiation therapy over a dose of 60 Gy in 6 weeks. The 3-year regional control was 86% for N0, 78% for N1, and 60% for N2 and N3. Among the tumor characteristics analyzed, the most useful ones for predicting local control and survival were clinical tumor staging parameters and tumor radiation-induced regression.

Treatment was inadequate (marginal excision alone) in 107 patients, local recurrence occurred in 112, and 128 patients developed metastases. Local recurrence was 3.5 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate and 2.5 times more common in patients with metastases than in those without. However, metastases were only 1.2 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate. Of the 128 patients who developed metastases, 63 had local recurrence and 65 had not. In these two subgroups the timing of metastases and the distribution of clinicopathologic factors--age, sex, tumor size, localization, depth, histotype, and malignancy grade--were similar. These findings indicate that local recurrence is of minor importance for development of metastases in soft tissue sarcoma. The increased local recurrence rate in metastatic tumors may be an expression of the aggressiveness of the primary tumor; highly malignant tumors combine a potential both for local and distant spread.

Based on eye examination results, the families were divided into 2 groups. In a first group of 34 families, all 61 members diagnosed as having polyps and 13 of the 33 patients at risk had 4 or more lesions distributed in both eyes.

Extra-colonic manifestations were present in 26 of 34 families in the first group and in 11 of 18 families in the second group. Data on one family with ambiguous ancestry were reviewed separately. The existence of 4 or more CHRPE lesions distributed in both eyes seems to be a congenital marker for FAP, present in 65.4 percent of families. When present in a family: 1) it is found in all diagnosed patients in that family, 2) can therefore be considered predictive for the development of polyps in other family members who carry the trait, and 3) if confirmed by longer follow-up, may possibly preclude members without the trait from further evaluation and surveillance.

Included in the group of patients with mitral regurgitation were 12 with atrioventricular canal defect, six with chordal and leaflet defects, one with Marfan's syndrome, and one with bacterial endocarditis. Prostheses included 12 Bjork-Shiley (17 mm), seven St. Jude Medical (19 mm in four, 21 mm in three), five stent-mounted dura mater valves (12 mm to 16 mm), and one porcine xenograft (19 mm). In four patients the valves were placed in the left atrium in a supraannular location. There were nine operative (atrioventricular canal defect seven, mitral regurgitation two) and five late (atrioventricular canal defect four, mitral stenosis one) deaths, giving actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates of 52% and 43%, respectively. All 6 patients with tissue valves died; the four with supraannular mitral valve replacement survived. Since 1983 operative mortality has been reduced to 0% (70% confidence limits 0% to 24%). Nine patients required a second mitral valve replacement for prosthetic stenosis 5 to 69 (mean 30) months after the original mitral valve replacement (one operative death). Because of improvements in repair of atrioventricular canal defect in infancy, the need for mitral valve replacement at atrioventricular canal defect repair has decreased. Although valvuloplasty has been advocated for repair of congenital mitral valve disease and is applicable in some infants with mitral regurgitation, mitral valve replacement is frequently unavoidable for congenital mitral disease and can now be accomplished at a low operative risk, even when the prosthesis has to be positioned supraannularly. \",\n",

       " '641': 'Cytomegalovirus colitis in AIDS: presentation in 44 patients and a review of the literature. As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ganciclovir in cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, the clinical characteristics of 44 patients enrolled at one center were analyzed in detail. All were homosexual men who had CMV on colonic biopsy. CMV colitis was the index diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 11 (25%) of the 44 patients. All had diarrhea, but it was intermittent in 13 patients (30%). Bleeding was uncommon, but 35 patients (80%) were febrile (median temperature of 38.9 degrees C). Weight loss was reported by 39 patients (89%), among whom the median loss was 6.8 kg. Endoscopy revealed normal colonic mucosa but CMV on biopsy in 11 patients (25%). Colonoscopic biopsies positive for CMV were found only in the cecum in 7 (39%) of 18 patients. Most patients (54%) had received zidovudine before the diagnosis of CMV colitis. The median time to the development of CMV colitis after the diagnosis of AIDS was 16 months in those patients who had received zidovudine and 3 months in those who had not (p less than 0.02). We conclude that CMV colitis can present early in AIDS and often with such nonspecific signs as fever, intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and hematochezia. Importantly, it can appear normal on colonoscopy and occurs frequently only in the right colon, necessitating full colonoscopy and multiple biopsies for accurate diagnosis. ',\n",

In the search for immunoreagents appropriate for the histopathologic diagnosis of malignant B-cell lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections, a new monoclonal antibody, Ki-B5, was generated using a high-grade B-cell lymphoma as the immunogene. Ki-B5 is a mouse IgG1/kappa that recognizes five protein fractions of about 84, 82, 55, 48, and 27 Kd after biosynthetic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. Protein fractions with the molecular weights of approximately 84 and 82 Kd were expressed on the cell surface and show that Ki-B5 is probably unrelated to CD45. It was possible through electron microscopy to visualize the membrane-bound portion of Ki-B5. Extensive immunohistologic studies on normal human tissue and various neoplasias demonstrated the high specificity of Ki-B5 to normal human B cells and a minor subgroup of plasma cells. Except for ML-2, which is a myelomonocytic human cell line, Ki-B5 exclusively recognized the B-cell lineage, including EB-3, BALL-1, and NALM-1. All carcinomas, sarcomas, and malignant melanomas tested with Ki-B5 were negative. Although normal granulocytes and monocytes were constantly negative, three of eight myelomonocytic leukemias coreacted with this antibody. Eight of the 57 T-cell lymphomas studied were positive to Ki-B5. Five were classified as lymphoblastic, two represented T8-CLL, and one was classified as immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Only 3 of 126 cases of B-cell lymphoma, including rare types not considered in the current classifications, were negative to Ki-B5. Plasmacytomas were also negative, except for one case. Irrespective of the cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma and plasmacytoma, Ki-B5 represents a new monoclonal antibody appropriate for the diagnosis and immunophenotyping of malignant lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections.

Large regenerative nodules in cirrhotic livers may accumulate iron and develop internal iron-poor foci of hyperplasia or malignancy. Magnetic resonance examinations were performed on 23 patients with biopsy-proved cirrhosis. A \"nodule-within-nodule\" appearance was noted in two patients. This appearance consisted of markedly low intensity of a large nodule on gradient-echo images, with one or two internal foci that were isointense to the liver. Each of the large nodules was 2 cm in diameter, and each of the internal foci was less than 1 cm. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal in both patients. Aspiration biopsy performed in one patient failed to show malignancy, but histologic confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma was obtained eventually in both cases. The nodule-within-nodule sign, which reflects the unique histopathology of hepatocellular carcinoma in large siderotic regenerative nodules, is strongly suggestive of early hepatocellular carcinoma, even if serologic markers and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.

If the endotracheal tube was size 7.5 or greater, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was used, whereas if the endotracheal tube size was below 7, a rigid bronchoscope was used.

The histology also distinguished lung infection from rejection.

       " '646': 'The effects of tumor necrosis factor on intestinal structure and metabolism. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a polypeptide produced predominantly by activated macrophages, is an important mediator of sepsis. We analyzed the specific metabolic changes that occur in the gut following TNF administration. Following general anesthesia, hemodynamic and metabolic indices were measured serially in control dogs (n = 7) and animals receiving a continuous sublethal intravenous infusion of TNF (0.57.10(5) IU/kg/6 hours, n = 7). During TNF infusion mean arterial pressure gradually decreased despite fluid administration, which maintained wedge pressure and cardiac index, which were similar to control animals. While TNF significantly reduced intestinal blood flow to 12 +/- 3 mL/min/kg compared to 28 +/- 3 mL/min/kg (p less than 0.01) in controls, intestinal oxygen consumption was maintained due to an increased extraction rate. Despite hypoperfusion the intestinal exchange of metabolic substrate (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and ammonia) was comparable between the control and TNF-infused animals. However, when substrate carbon balance across the intestinal tract was calculated, it appeared that there was a limitation in fuel availability in the TNF animals. This may be due to competition for fuel between the gut and other major organs. Fuel limitation may jeopardize rapid cell proliferation and mucosal repair and with regional hypoperfusion these processes may account for the mucosal ulcerations observed at the termination of the study.

Also, to find out if the technique can predict whether manual aspiration will be successful, hence avoiding the need for intercostal tube drainage. DESIGN--Prospective study of 25 episodes of pneumothorax during which patients breathed air from a Douglas bag that contained chlorofluorocarbon gases from a metered dose inhaler while the pneumothorax was aspirated. SETTING--Medical unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--22 patients who presented over nine months with acute pneumothorax. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence or absence of chlorofluorocarbon marker gases in the aspirate. Presence or absence of sustained re-expansion of the affected lung in the chest radiograph. RESULTS--Marker gas was detected in the aspirate from 16 out of 25 pneumothoraces. Of these, 13 required intercostal tube drainage because of failure of the lung to re-expand. Marker gas was not detected in nine cases, and in all of these cases manual aspiration resulted in sustained re-expansion of the lung. CONCLUSIONS--The presence or absence of a pleural leak during manual aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax can be shown by using this technique. The absence of marker gas in the aspirate implies that manual aspiration will be successful, whereas its presence predicts, in most cases, either failure of manual aspiration to expand the lung or early re-collapse of the lung.

Descending influences on the spinal nociceptive tail-flick (TF) reflex produced by focal electrical stimulation and glutamate microinjection in the nuclei reticularis gigantocellularis (NGC) and gigantocellularis pars alpha (NGC alpha) were examined and characterized in rats lightly anesthetized with pentobarbital. Both inhibition and facilitation of the TF reflex were produced by electrical stimulation at identical sites in the NGC/NGC alpha; glutamate microinjection only inhibited the TF reflex. The chronaxie of stimulation for inhibition of the TF reflex was 169 +/- 28 microseconds. Inhibition of the TF reflex by stimulation was produced throughout the NGC and NGC alpha; intensities of stimulation for inhibition were least in the ventral NGC and in the NGC alpha. At threshold intensities of stimulation, inhibition of the TF reflex did not outlast the period of stimulation. Facilitation of the TF reflex was produced at many of the same sites at which stimulation inhibited the TF reflex, but always at lesser intensities of stimulation (mean, 10 microA vs. 43 microA for inhibition, n = 25). Stimulation in the NGC/NGC alpha at threshold intensities for facilitation or inhibition of the TF reflex did not significantly affect blood pressure. Strength-duration characterization of electrical stimulation and microinjection of glutamate into identical sites in the NGC and NGC alpha suggest that descending inhibition of the TF reflex results from activation of cell bodies in the NGC and NGC alpha.

In order to model crypt abscesses, a histological finding which correlates with disease activity in intestinal inflammation, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were layered onto monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line T84, a crypt-like epithelium which is capable of Cl- secretion. Such PMN-epithelial interaction had no substantial effect on monolayer integrity or function. However, when PMN were stimulated by conditions including those present naturally in the human colonic lumen, monolayers responded with a bumetanide-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) indicative of Cl- secretion, the basis of secretory diarrhea. This Isc response was induced by a neutrophil-derived secretagogue (NDS), which was only active when applied to the luminal surface of monolayers and did not require PMN-epithelial contact. NDS activity is resistant to boiling, acid, and trypsin and passes a 500 nominal mol wt cutoff filter. NDS activity is not secondary to the respiratory burst products O2- or H2O2 and does not appear to be a myeloperoxidase product. We speculate NDS elicited Cl- secretion may contribute to the secretory diarrhea seen in patients with intestinal inflammation and crypt abscesses. ',\n",

The present study assessed the preferential renal secretion and hepatic degradation of renin forms in humans. The renin form profile of secreted renal renin was determined before transplant in an ex vivo kidney donor perfusion system and compared with the peripheral plasma multiple renin form profile of normal subjects. The effect of hepatic degradation on renin forms was assessed in hepatic vein plasma in comparison with infrarenal vena cava plasma in hypertensive patients during renal vein renin studies. The results revealed a significantly greater proportion of the more basic forms in the perfusate of donor kidneys compared with normal plasma. In hypertensive patients the proportion of the more basic renin forms in the hepatic vein was significantly decreased in comparison with the infrarenal vena cava. Thus, the human kidney may preferentially secrete the more basic renin forms. In contrast, the liver preferentially degrades the more basic forms, giving these forms a shorter plasma half-life. The preferential secretion and clearance of the more basic forms of renin may contribute to short-term control of human renin-angiotensin system activity. ',\n",

Subjects were then randomly assigned to either drink a low alcohol beer alone for a 4-week period (reducing their self-reported alcohol consumption from 537 to 57 ml/week) or to continue their usual alcohol intake (543 versus 557 ml/week). Within the low and normal alcohol intake groups, subjects were assigned to either a low or normal sodium intake. The low sodium groups continued the sodium-restricted diet but were switched to placebo sodium chloride tablets for the 4 weeks. This resulted in a fall in the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from 144 to 69 mmol/day. The normal sodium groups continued the low sodium diet but kept taking 100 mmol/day of the sodium chloride tablets, and their urinary sodium excretion remained unchanged (125 versus 142 mmol/day).

To determine the frequency and significance of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in patients without clinical evidence of myocardial infarction, we reviewed the two-dimensional echocardiograms of 252 patients who had no history or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction and who subsequently underwent coronary angiography. Seventy-seven patients (31%) had one or more segmental wall motion abnormalities. Sixty-six of the 77 patients (86%) had significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter stenosis). Seventy-four percent of the patients with coronary artery disease had multivessel disease. The left ventricle was divided into anterior and posterior regions. In the 66 patients, there were 77 separate regions with wall motion abnormalities (49 hypokinesis, 22 akinesis, 6 dyskinesis), including 60 regions (78%) supplied by coronary vessels with greater than or equal to 70% stenosis. Thirty-two patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Follow-up echocardiograms were obtained in 19 patients who had wall motion abnormalities involving 22 regions. Twenty of the 22 regions were revascularized. Wall motion improved in 17 of 20 regions (85%) and returned to normal in 15 regions (75%). We conclude that segmental wall motion abnormalities may be detected by echocardiography in up to one third of patients evaluated for suspected coronary artery disease without documented myocardial infarction. These abnormalities are associated with a high likelihood of multivessel disease as well as with significant narrowing of the artery supplying the region demonstrating abnormal wall motion. Improvement in segmental wall motion abnormalities after revascularization suggests that these areas represent regions of hibernating myocardium. ',\n",

       " '657': 'Acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis: a review of treatment approaches. Some authors describe acute bacterial prostatitis as a self-limiting disease, and as with any other acute septic condition, parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated. Chronic bacterial prostatitis, however, is associated with a causative organism persisting unaltered in prostatic fluid and leading to relapsing urinary tract infections. In the 1970s, several workers produced a classification system and bacteriologic localization cultures for establishing the diagnosis of prostatitis. Krieger and Crawford point to an important factor that is omitted in many clinical trials with episodes of chronic bacterial prostatitis in men. If localization studies of the prostate infection are attempted in the presence of bacteriuria, the urine must be sterilized with nitrofurantoin or penicillin G. Urine cultures obtained from first-voided urine, bladder urine, and urine voided after prostatic massage should show no growth, and the expressed prostatic secretion can then be examined for evidence of prostatic infection. This procedure reduces the contamination of the expressed prostatic secretion by the organism from the urinary tract infection. This is important, because antibiotic treatment is determined by the sensitivity of the organism isolated from the prostate as well as by the ability of the antibiotics to penetrate the prostate. Meares outlines the pharmacokinetic features needed for drug diffusion into prostatic fluid and provides detailed information on the physical characteristics of the prostate during acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis. Unfortunately, the choice of an ideal drug cannot be extrapolated from this information because pharmacodynamic principles cannot predict clinical efficacy. Some authors find that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim has the best cure rate in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis. ',\n",

Through 2 h of CPB and the following 6 h of critical care, there was no difference between CPB-12 and CPB-16 regarding most cardiopulmonary functional variables. Plasma epinephrine was markedly elevated immediately after initiation of CPB (p less than .01 at 1 min CPB vs. basal) and returned rapidly to basal concentrations. Comparison of plasma epinephrine levels between CPB and standard CPR groups showed that responses to cardiac arrest were similar (p greater than .05 at 1 min CPB vs. 11.5 min CPR).

A variety of perturbations of calcium metabolism are reported to occur in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) compared to its genetic control the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY), including significant dysfunction of calcium handling by the proximal renal tubule of the SHR, resulting in impaired active calcium transport in the gut and an apparent renal calcium leak. We explored the intestinal and renal epithelia of 12- to 14-week-old SHR and WKY using electron microscopy. Biochemical comparisons of these transport epithelia included measurements of three vitamin D dependent cellular proteins and one structural protein: alkaline phosphatase, intestinal CaBP9K, renal CaBP28K, and villin expression. Electron microscopy demonstrated a patchy loss in microvilli in the SHR, accounting for approximately 10 to 15% of the total microvillar surface. In the kidney, morphological abnormalities were observed only in the proximal renal tubule. Again, there was patchy loss of microvilli from the brush border membrane. In SHR duodenal alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly reduced compared to the WKY (0.145 +/- 0.002 v 0.186 +/- 0.002 integrated extinction/min/micron 3 X 10(3) brush border (P less than .001). Duodenal CaBP9K and renal CaBP28K were significantly reduced in SHR compared to WKY. There were no differences in villin expression. These data are consistent with the previously characterized disturbances of active calcium transport in the intestine and inappropriate renal calcium leak in the SHR. While a possible link between these disturbances and hypertension remains to be determined, this study provides supportive evidence for a primary disturbance in cell calcium handling and transporting epithelia in this form of genetic hypertension.

The expression of proto-oncogenes from the monolayer cultures of the cancer cell lines is poorly correlated with the anchorage independency of the cells.

Splenectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease who develop massive splenomegaly with accompanying hypersplenism and/or mechanical pressure symptoms. The charts of 48 patients with Gaucher's disease undergoing splenectomy at our institution between January 1963 and December 1989 were analyzed to determine the short- and long-term results of this procedure. Thirty-five (73%) patients had total splenectomy, whereas 13 (27%) patients had partial splenectomy. There was one postoperative death (after total splenectomy), and 13 patients (27%) had postoperative complications. Eleven patients (23%) presented with accelerated bone disease after total splenectomy (mean follow-up: 96 months). No patients having partial splenectomy (mean follow-up: 25 months) developed progressive bone disease. Eight patients have died since surgery. All four deaths due to malignant disease occurred in patients after total splenectomy. The results of this largest-ever reported series of splenectomy for Gaucher's disease confirm that while either total or partial splenectomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality, total splenectomy is accompanied by more aggressive bone disease and a predisposition to malignancy.

One hundred patients with clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of aortic aneurysms were evaluated prospectively during the period July 1987 to December 1989. All patients underwent CT scanning as an initial evaluation. Patients were selected for angiography if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: radiographic evidence of thoracoabdominal or juxtarenal aneurysms, or horseshoe kidney; or clinical suggestion of renal artery stenosis, mesenteric arterial insufficiency, aortoiliac occlusive disease, or lower extremity aneurysmal disease. During this period 19 patients (19%) underwent both CT scanning and angiography. The indications for angiography were thoracoabdominal aneurysms (7), juxtarenal aneurysms (2), clinical evidence of mesenteric insufficiency (1) or renal insufficiency (2), evidence of lower extremity aneurysmal disease (3), or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (4). Eighty-one patients (81%) underwent CT scanning as the only radiographic evaluation. No patient was adversely affected by elimination of angiographic evaluation.

Significant growth retardation was found in 115 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed their growth. These children were diagnosed before 12 years of age and treated on four protocols in a single institution; all received either cranial (n = 78) or craniospinal (n = 37) prophylactic irradiation. Patients' heights at diagnosis were within expected ranges, but final heights were greater than or equal to 1 SD below population means in 74% of cases and greater than or equal to 2 SD in 37%. Effects on growth were more pronounced for children who had received craniospinal irradiation, but decrements were also significant in the cranial irradiation group, with adult heights greater than or equal to 2 SD below population norms in 32%. Growth retardation was significantly greater (P less than .0001) in children who had earlier disease onset. Growth deceleration occurred not only during chemotherapy but during a later period that followed an interval of improved growth in many cases. Thus, late decrements in growth may be missed in studies that do not follow patients until they have attained final heights. These findings indicate that abnormally short stature among survivors of ALL merits further clinical and research attention. \",\n",
       " '668': 'Effect of epidermal growth factor in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole on the healing of chronic gastric ulcers in the rat. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to enhance healing of experimental gastric ulcers when given subcutaneously or orally in the drinking water. This effect of EGF occurs without reducing gastric acid secretion. On the other hand, EGF reportedly is excreted rapidly from gastric lumen when administered by intragastric bolus. This suggests that further stimulation of ulcer healing may be expected if EGF is given with an acid-suppressive agent or with an agent allowing EGF to remain in rat gastric lumen at high concentrations. In the present study, EGF administered by gastric intubation at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, which is three times smaller than reported in previous studies, was evaluated for its effect on acetic acid-induced rat gastric ulcers in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole. Sucralfate is well known selectively to bind proteins covering the ulcer base, and omeprazole is a potent acid-suppressive agent. Prior to the study of combined EGF and sucralfate, oral sucralfate was confirmed to allow endogenous gastric EGF and mouse EGF given exogenously to remain at high concentrations in gastric contents and tissues. EGF and sucralfate (2 g/kg/day) given alone failed to stimulate ulcer healing in submandibularectomized rats (SMR rat) whose endogenous gastric EGF was depleted. However, the combination of both drugs administered at the same doses significantly accelerated ulcer healing in the SMR rat. Omeprazole (200 mg/kg/day) significantly enhanced ulcer healing regardless of removal of the submandibular glands. The combination of EGF and omeprazole further stimulated ulcer healing in the SMR rat. ',\n",

In a retrospective study of 530 consecutive patients presenting to our unit as acute uraemic emergencies over a six-year period, 85 (16 per cent) had renovascular disease that was considered to be responsible for their loss of renal function. Twenty-one (4 per cent) patients had uraemia which could be clearly attributable to ACE inhibitor treatment; 18 of these cases were shown to have significant renovascular pathology. Following withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor the renal failure reversed in the majority of patients. We also examined 400 consecutive hypertensive patients referred over a similar period and, although vascular imaging was performed only when it was considered to be clinically indicated, 58 (14.5 per cent) of these patients were shown to have renovascular pathology. A further five patients with stable chronic renal disease were seen to have a deterioration in their glomerular filtration rate coincident with commencement of ACE inhibitor therapy; this reversed when the agents were withdrawn. These observations indicate that significant renovascular disease may be more common than has been hitherto recognized and that injudicious use of ACE inhibitors may result in serious complications. Methods which may minimize such iatrogenic disease are suggested. ',\n",

       " '672': 'Synergistic effects of nerve growth factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on human basophilic cell differentiation. We have recently shown that nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes human granulopoiesis, specifically augmenting basophilic cell differentiation observed in methylcellulose hematopoietic colony assays of human peripheral blood. Because the NGF effect was seen in the presence of conditioned medium derived from a human T-cell line (Mo-CM) containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), we examined interactions of purified NGF and recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) on granulocyte growth and differentiation. rhGM-CSF stimulated a dose-dependent increase in methylcellulose colony growth at concentrations between 0.1 U/mL and 10 U/mL, and in the presence of NGF at 500 ng/mL this effect was enhanced. The number of basophilic cell colony-forming units (CFU-Baso) and histamine-positive colonies increased synergistically when NGF was added to rhGM-CSF. Furthermore, because Mo-CM acts with sodium butyrate to promote basophilic differentiation of alkaline-passaged myeloid leukemia cells, HL-60, we also examined the interaction of NGF and Mo-CM or rhGM-CSF using this assay. In the presence of NGF, Mo-CM at concentrations of 0.5% to 20% vol/vol, and rhGM-CSF at concentrations of 0.1 U/mL to 100 U/mL synergistically increased histamine production by butyrate-induced, alkaline-passaged HL-60 cells; this was associated with the appearance of metachromatic, tryptase-negative, IgE receptor-positive cells. The effects of rhGM-CSF or Mo-CM were completely abrogated by a specific anti-rhGM-CSF neutralizing antibody in methylcellulose, with or without NGF; the NGF synergy with rhGM-CSF in the HL-60 assay was also inhibited by either anti-rhGM-CSF or anti-NGF antibody. These studies support the notion that differentiation in the basophilic lineage may be enhanced by NGF acting to increase the number of GM-CSF-responsive basophilic cell progenitors. ',\n",
       " '673': 'Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. III. Models of ischemic and hypoxic/ischemic injury in the immature puppy heart. This study compares the metabolic and functional effects of three different models of ischemia in the immature heart. The intent was (1) to develop a model of energy-depleted and functionally depressed heart to be used in subsequent studies of myocardial protection and (2) to characterize the biochemical changes following different interventions. Forty-five minutes of normothermic global ischemia produced severe depletion of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate (greater than 70%) but was associated with 85% +/- 10% recovery of left ventricular function. Postischemic functional depression (less than 30% recovery) could be produced by either (1) extending the ischemic duration to 60 minutes or (2) preceding 45 minutes of ischemia by 60 minutes of hypoxic stress (oxygen tension 25 to 30 mm Hg). Neither of these more severe interventions caused more profound depletion of adenosine triphosphate or creatine phosphate, but hypoxic stress produced marked tissue depletion of glutamate (52%) and aspartate (48%) before aortic clamping. Longer ischemia or preceding hypoxia led to greater myocardial accumulation of lactate (greater than 250 versus 104 mumol/gm dry weight) and succinate (18 versus 11 mumol/gm dry weight) during aortic clamping, p less than 0.05 versus 45 minutes of ischemia) and greater postischemic depression and amino acid (greater than 65% aspartate depletion) and carbohydrate (greater than 50% glycogen depletion) metabolism, p less than 0.05 versus simple ischemia. These findings suggest that more severe ischemic/hypoxic models are needed in immature hearts to produce functional depression, and the biochemical analyses suggest the characteristics of metabolic defects that must be corrected to resuscitate these hearts during surgical correction of congenital defects.

A patient who developed recurring adductor spasms 1 year after nerve section was reexplored, with identification of neural regrowth into the distal segment of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The technique of neural avulsion removing the distal nerve up to its insertion into the laryngeal muscles is described. Neural regrowth, which is just one of the possible mechanisms for recurrence of spastic dysphonia, should be prevented by this surgical modification. Twelve patients who have undergone neural avulsion primarily for spastic dysphonia are being followed up without recurrence of symptoms thus far.

Two-thirds of the distal pressures recorded were between 10 and 20 mmHg and 98 per cent were less than 50 mmHg; the peak distal pressure was 90 mmHg. Four patients had distal repetitive tonic contractions creating a pressure difference across the anastomosis with a mean of 20 mmHg and a peak of 45 mmHg. Each contraction persisted for 15-20 min.

The presence of meningeal involvement in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Conventional methods of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) leukemia rely on the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell morphology, which may produce ambiguous results in the presence of minimal leukemic involvement. A methodology has been developed for immunophenotyping small numbers of CSF cells while preserving cell morphology. CSF samples from 33 children with CD10 (common ALL antigen [CALLA]) positive ALL were examined at initial presentation using both conventional morphology and this combined immunohistopathologic technique. Six (18%) of the samples contained lymphoblasts or cells considered morphologically suspicious for leukemic involvement. Nine additional samples (27% of the total) had normal CSF morphology, but contained increased numbers of CALLA positive cells. Twelve of the 33 samples were also examined for the simultaneous presence of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and demonstrated increased numbers of cells positive for both TdT and CD10. These data suggest that a large proportion of children with ALL may have abnormalities of CSF cells at initial diagnosis consistent with the presence of occult leukemic involvement. ',\n",

To validate a recent proposal that a phospholipid lining with a high content of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine may protect gastric mucosa against luminal acid, it was decided to study composition and metabolism of phospholipids in the gastric mucosa. Phospholipids were analyzed in rat, human, and dog gastric mucosal surface tissue and in a chloroform/methanol-lavage of rat and canine stomach. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the main components. Saturated fatty acids were almost exclusively esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine, and unsaturated fatty acids mainly at the sn-2 position. The disaturated class of phosphatidylcholine comprised 2%-6% of total phosphatidylcholine. Precursors of phosphatidylcholine, i.e., [32P]orthophosphate and [methyl-14C]choline, were preferentially incorporated into the disaturated molecular class 0.5-6 hours after IV administration. It can be speculated that disaturated phosphatidylcholine, although quantitatively a minor component, is specifically triggered in mucosal renewal processes. ',\n",

The routine, archival paraffin wax embedded diagnostic blocks from these cases were also analysed. Nineteen (95%) of the tumours were shown to contain aneuploid stemlines by systematic sampling, but if only one of these systematic tissue blocks had been taken from each case the incidence of DNA aneuploidy could have been as low as 45%. Only 15 (75%) tumours were aneuploid when all the routine archival blocks were analysed, but by specifically selecting tumour areas from the archival material the accuracy of this method was increased to 90%.

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptors were characterized in membranes obtained from prostate tissue of patients affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) before and after treatment with a GnRH agonist analog. Binding of [125I]IGF-I to membranes obtained from untreated patients was specific and time and temperature dependent. Analysis of the binding data yielded two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity (Kd, 10(-11) mol/L) and one of lower affinity (Kd, 10(-9) mol/L). BPH membrane preparations were affinity-cross linked to labeled IGF-I, and then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis by autoradiography revealed one labeled protein with an apparent Mr = 300K under nonreducing conditions and two labeled protein with Mr = 270K and Mr = 130K under reducing conditions. Excess unlabeled IGF-II reduce both of them, whereas the same excess of IGF-I completely abolished them. In membrane preparations of prostatic tissues from patients affected by BPH and treated for 2 months with a GnRH agonist analog, the binding capacities of both binding sites were significantly higher than those of BPH tissue from untreated patients, whereas binding affinities were unchanged. The IGF-I receptor in BPH prostate tissue of untreated patients was mainly localized in the basal layer of the epithelium, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining, whereas in the tissue from treated patients positive staining was found also in the glandular epithelium. These results demonstrate that: 1) specific binding sites for IGF-I are present in prostatic tissue from patients with BPH, 2) androgen deprivation increases their binding capacities and seems to modify their epithelial localization.

Trapping of red blood cells (RBCs) in renal medulla vasculature in postischemic acute renal failure (ARF) was found to depend upon the length of the ischemic period. Thus trapping occurred after 45 minutes but not 25 minutes of ischemia. By prior hemodilution to a hematocrit (hct) of 30%, RBC trapping after 45 minutes of ischemia could be completely prevented. Likewise hemo-concentration (hct = 60%) before 25 minutes of ischemia resulted in extensive RBC trapping. By increasing or decreasing the hct, the contribution of RBC trapping to the functional defects and decrease in renal blood flow that follows minor (25 min) and more substantial (45 min) ischemia was investigated. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured by microspheres, and vascular and tubular pressure by the micropuncture technique. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from inulin clearance, and tubular function from urine osmolality and sodium and potassium excretion. It was found that postischemic RBF was not correlated to RBC trapping but depended on the length of ischemia. After both 25 and 45 minutes of ischemia tubular obstructions occurred in the proximal tubules and/or loops of Henle, causing an increase in proximal tubular pressure. These obstructions were dependent on the length of ischemia but not on RBC trapping. After hemoconcentration and 25 minutes of ischemia there was an increment in distal tubular pressure, indicating that abundant RBC trapping may contribute to an increase in tubular pressure by compression of medullary tubules and thereby reduce GFR. When the damage was more severe other factors came into play and the contribution of RBC trapping to the decrease in GFR was minimal. ',\n",

Variables that correlated most strongly with the mean RR interval during atrial fibrillation were the AV node effective refractory period (r = 0.93; p less than 0.001), AV node functional refractory period (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001) and shortest atrial pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.91; p less than 0.001). The AH interval during sinus rhythm (r = 0.74; p less than 0.001) and during atrial pacing at the shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.52; p less than 0.001) had weaker correlations. Measures of concealed conduction did not improve the prediction of the mean or longest ventricular cycle length during atrial fibrillation. In conclusion, the refractory periods and conductivity of the AV node are the best indicators of the potential of the node to transmit atrial impulses to the ventricles during atrial fibrillation. The degree of concealed conduction in the AV node is a less important determinant of the mean ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation. ',\n",

To assess the effect of nicardipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function independent of concurrent effects on loading conditions in patients with LV systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease, equihypotensive doses of intravenous nitroprusside and nicardipine were administered to 12 patients with congestive heart failure due to previous myocardial infarction (LV ejection fraction less than 0.40). LV micromanometer pressure and simultaneous radionuclide volume were obtained during a baseline period, during nitroprusside infusion, during a second baseline period and during nicardipine infusion. Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased an average of 21 mm Hg with nitroprusside and 19 mm Hg with nicardipine. A greater decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure was observed with nitroprusside (29 +/- 2 to 15 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than with nicardipine (29 +/- 2 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). There was a decrease in the time constant of relaxation during nitroprusside but not during nicardipine infusion. There was enough overlap in LV volumes in the baseline and nitroprusside periods to compare diastolic pressure-volume relations over a common range of volumes in 4 patients, and enough overlap in the baseline and nicardipine periods in 11 patients. The relation was shifted downward in 3 of 4 patients taking nitroprusside and in 6 of 11 patients taking nicardipine. The relation between end-diastolic pressure and volume was not shifted with nicardipine. ',\n",

Morphologic evaluation of bone marrow for neuroblastoma cells is a routine and important component of clinical staging. Specific immunostaining of malignant cells with monoclonal antibodies should be more sensitive, however, and may improve the detection of metastases and provide additional prognostic information. METHODS. We looked for tumor cells in bone marrow from 197 patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma, using immunoperoxidase staining with monoclonal antibodies (immunocytologic analysis) and examination of smears and specimens obtained by trephine biopsy (conventional analysis). RESULTS. Routine smears and trephine-biopsy specimens were positive for tumor cells in 46 percent of the patients, whereas 67 percent were positive on immunocytologic analysis (P less than 0.0001). Immunocytologic analysis detected bone marrow metastases in 34 percent of patients considered to have only localized or regional disease (Stage I, II, or III). It also identified tumor cells that were not detected by conventional analysis in patients with widespread disease (Stage IV or IVS). Tumor content, as determined by immunocytologic analysis, predicted clinical outcome in relation to the age of the patient at diagnosis. Patients with Stage II or III disease diagnosed after one year of age who did not have occult marrow metastases did well, whereas those with metastases did poorly (P = 0.006). Patients in whom Stage IV disease was diagnosed before they were one year of age did well if bone marrow metastases were few or absent, but had poor survival if the marrow contained more than 0.02 percent tumor cells (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS. Immunocytologic analysis of bone marrow aspirates is more sensitive than conventional analysis in detecting tumor cells and provides prognostic information. The relations among marrow metastases, age at diagnosis, and clinical outcome illustrate the biologic heterogeneity of neuroblastoma. ',\n",

This study examined the implications of left ventricular (LV) dilatation and increased pulmonary thallium uptake during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia. The lung-to-heart thallium ratio in the initial images was significantly higher in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than normal subjects; 0.48 +/- 0.16 in 3-vessel disease (n = 16), 0.43 +/- 0.10 in 2-vessel disease (n = 20), 0.43 +/- 0.08 in 1-vessel disease (n = 16) and 0.36 +/- 0.05 in normal subjects (n = 7) (p less than 0.001, 0.09 and 0.06, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the severity and the extent of the perfusion abnormality (determined from the polar maps) and the lung-to-heart thallium ratio (r = 0.51 and 0.52, respectively, p less than 0.0002). There was also a significant correlation between lung thallium washout and lung-to-heart thallium ratio (r = 0.42, p = 0.0009) and peak heart rate (r = -0.49, p less than 0.0001). The LV dilatation was mostly due to an increase in cavity dimension (30% increase) and to a lesser extent (6% increase) due to increase in LV size. (The cavity dimensions were measured from the short-axis slices at the midventricular level in the initial and delayed images). The dilation was seen in patients with CAD but not in the normal subjects. These changes correlated with the extent and severity of the thallium perfusion abnormality. Thus, adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia may cause LV dilation and increased lung thallium uptake on the basis of subendocardial ischemia. ',\n",
       " '702': 'Interstitial chemotherapy with drug polymer implants for the treatment of recurrent gliomas. Malignant gliomas have been difficult to treat with chemotherapy. The most effective agent, BCNU (carmustine), has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum. To obviate these problems, a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. In this Phase I-II study, 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant. Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively, upon completion of tumor debulking. The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks. Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels. There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself. The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group, 64 weeks for the second dose group, and 32 weeks for the highest dose group. The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation. The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer. Frequent hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy. Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe, a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started. The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma. ',\n",
       " '703': 'Mechanism of glucoregulatory responses to stress and their deficiency in diabetes. During exercise, increased energy demands are met by increased glucose production that occurs simultaneously with the increased glucose uptake. We had previously observed that, during exercise, metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCR) increases markedly in normal, but only marginally in poorly controlled diabetic dogs. We wished to determine (i) whether in a more general model of stress matched increases in rate of appearance of glucose and MCR also occur, or if MCR is suppressed, as during catecholamine infusion; and (ii) whether diabetes affects stress-induced changes in rate of glucose appearance and MCR. Therefore, we injected carbachol (27 nmol/50 microliters), an analog of acetylcholine, intracerebroventricularly in seven conscious dogs before and after induction of alloxan diabetes. In normal dogs, plasma epinephrine and cortisol increased 4- to 5-fold, whereas norepinephrine and glucagon doubled. Plasma insulin, however, remained unchanged. Tracer-determined hepatic glucose production increased rapidly, but transiently, by 2.5-fold. This increment can be fully explained by the observed increments in the counterregulatory hormones. Surprisingly, however, MCR also promptly increased, and therefore, plasma glucose changed only marginally. After induction of diabetes, the animals were given intracerebroventricular carbachol while plasma glucose was maintained at moderate hyperglycemia (9.0 +/- 0.4 mM). Increments in counterregulatory hormones were similar to those seen in normal dogs, except for exaggerated norepinephrine release. Peripheral insulin levels were higher in diabetic than in normal dogs; however, MCR was markedly reduced and the lipolytic response to stress increased, indicating insulin resistance. Interestingly, the hyperglycemic response to stress was 6-fold greater in diabetic than normal animals, relating mainly to the failure of MCR to rise. Plasma lactate increased equivalently in diabetic and normal animals despite suppression of MCR in the diabetics, indicating either greater muscle glycogenolysis and/or impairment in glucose oxidation. We conclude that in this stress model MCR increases as in exercise in normal but not in diabetic dogs. We speculate that glucose uptake in stress could be mediated through an insulin-dependent neural mechanism. ',\n",

We reviewed our 115-month experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) in adult and pediatric patients to determine whether there is a difference in the incidence of peritonitis between patients performing CAPD or CCPD. Peritonitis rates were similar in patients performing CAPD or CCPD in both the adult and pediatric age groups. The overall CAPD peritonitis rate was significantly lower in adult patients when compared with pediatric patients. There was no difference in peritonitis rates for CCPD between adult and pediatric patients. When the data are divided into 3-year subgroups, the incidence of peritonitis is significantly lower in adult patients undergoing either CAPD or CCPD when compared with pediatric patients during the years 1986 to 1988. There is significant improvement over time in the incidence of peritonitis in both adult and pediatric patients performing CCPD; similarly, there is a trend toward improvement in patients performing CAPD. Staphylococcus species organisms remain the most common bacterial cause of peritonitis, except in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years or with nephrostomies, where gram-negative rod infections were more common. Peritonitis resulted in discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis in a greater number of adult patients. These results suggest that the number of catheter manipulations is not important in determining the incidence of peritonitis. Pediatric patients are more likely than adult patients to develop peritonitis with either CAPD or CCPD. Adult patients are more likely than pediatric patients to discontinue peritoneal dialysis secondary to peritonitis. ',\n",

Primary pulmonary hypertension is a clinical syndrome characterized by pulmonary hypertension in the absence of sufficient underlying cardiac, parenchymal pulmonary, or systemic disease to account for it. The population of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension is a heterogeneous one, both clinically and histologically. As the etiologic mechanisms are unknown, therapy is directed toward the consequences of the pulmonary vascular process. Oxygen supplementation, the use of digoxin and diuretics for symptomatic heart failure, and anticoagulation all may have a role in treating primary pulmonary hypertension, although vasodilator therapy has been the main area of investigation. Screening for vasodilator responsiveness, defining a favorable vasodilator effect, predicting long-term effectiveness, and deciding who to treat have all been controversial. New approaches, such as use of high-dose calcium channel-blocking agents and continuous intravenous infusion of prostacyclin (an investigational agent), have recently been proposed.

The PPS group also had greater peak velocities in the main PA (76 vs 63 cm/s, p less than 0.05), right PA (193 vs 118 cm/s, p less than 0.001) and left PA (187 vs 123 cm/s, p less than 0.001). Similarly, the ratio of peak velocity in the branch/main PA was greater for the PPS group: right/main PA peak velocity = 2.91 vs 1.92, p less than 0.01, and left/main PA peak velocity = 2.73 vs 1.99, p less than 0.05. The calculated right ventricular output for the PPS group was more than the control group: 437 vs 261 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001. Hematocrits were not done on the control group, but the PPS group had an average hematocrit which was low (34%). It is concluded that patients with PPS have mild underdevelopment of the PA branches, with consequent increased flow velocity and turbulent flow.

Preoperative serum prostate specific antigen correlates well with morphometrically determined prostate tumor volume in prostatectomy specimens. However, since prostate specific antigen is produced by hyperplastic as well as malignant prostatic epithelium, the contribution of hyperplastic epithelium (benign prostatic hyperplasia) to serum prostate specific antigen interferes with the ability of serum prostate specific antigen to predict tumor volume in individual patients. We wondered if the removal of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue would increase the correlation between prostate specific antigen and tumor volume, and, thus, make prostate specific antigen a more accurate predictor of residual cancer volume after transurethral resection of the prostate. A total of 67 patients with clinical stage A cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (22, or 33%, with stage A1 and 45, or 67%, with stage A2 disease), and had pre-radical prostatectomy measurement of serum prostate specific antigen and morphometric determination of residual cancer volume in the radical prostatectomy specimen. The correlation between serum prostate specific antigen and residual cancer volume for all 67 patients was 0.66, and for stages A1 and A2 disease it was 0.64 and 0.70, respectively. All stage A1 cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of 1 ng./ml. or less had residual tumor volumes of less than 0.5 cc and all stage A cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of more than 10 ng./ml. had residual tumor volumes of greater than 0.5 cc. Of the patients 51% had levels of 1 to 10 ng./ml. and serum prostate specific antigen was not useful to predict residual tumor volume in this group.

We believe that the morphologic and functional evidence now strongly support a purposeful and biologically significant interaction between these two cell types. This interaction has physiologic consequences and appears to be able to regulate such local events as chloride ion secretion by epithelial cells of the intestinal and respiratory tracts in experimental models. In this way, the mast cell and nerve may be considered as a functional homeostatic regulatory unit. The extent to which this unit may be involved in maintenance of normal integrity of mucous membranes or other structures, in health and in disease, is not clear at the present and will require considerably more investigation and elucidation. However, the concept of such an interaction is an interesting one and may bring new approaches of a therapeutic and diagnostic nature to bear on some old problems. The observations reviewed in this report that psychologic conditioning may itself cause mucosal mast cell degranulation and mediator release in the rat is significant. We consider that this evidence of central nervous system control of mast cell degranulation is an extension of the idea that mast cells and nerves communicate. ',\n",

We found that both sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide strongly inhibited growth of BON, PT-2, and PT-SM cells. With continuous exposure of BON cells to sodium butyrate (2 mmol/L), the doubling time was prolonged, from 60 hours in controls to 156 hours, and saturation density was reduced to 28% that of controls. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (4 mmol/L) reduced saturation density to 37% that of controls in BON cells and prolonged the doubling time, from 60 hours to 103 hours. Antiproliferative effects of similar magnitudes were observed in the gastrinoma cell lines. In contrast, differential effects were produced on amine biosynthesis in BON cells; sodium butyrate stimulated levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the cells, whereas hexamethylene bisacetamide caused a profound dose-dependent inhibition of amine biosynthesis. The significant antiproliferative activity of sodium butyrate and hexamethylene bisacetamide and the inhibitory effects of hexamethylene bisacetamide on amine biosynthesis warrant evaluation of these agents or analogues for treatment of metastatic carcinoid and gastrinoma.

Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (ADRP) has recently been linked to locus D3S47 (probe C17), with no recombination, in a single large Irish family. Other ADRP pedigrees have shown linkage at zero recombination, linkage with recombination, and no linkage, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity. The gene encoding rhodopsin, the rod photoreceptor pigment, is closely linked to locus D3S47 on chromosome 3q. A point mutation changing a conserved proline to histidine in the 23d codon of the gene has been demonstrated in affected members of one ADRP family and in 17 of 148 unrelated ADRP patients. We have sequenced the rhodopsin gene in a C17-linked ADRP family and have identified in the 4th exon and in-frame 3-bp deletion which deletes one of the two isoleucine monomers at codons 255 and 256. This mutation was not found in 30 other unrelated ADRP families. The deletion has arisen in the sequence TCATCATCAT, deleting one of a run of three x 3-bp repeats. The mechanism by which this occurred may be similar to that which creates length variation in so-called mini- and microsatellites.

Over one year, 254 consecutive patients who consulted their GP for chronic abdominal pain were asked to answer a guided questionnaire. A checklist of simple parameters suggestive of the presence of organic diseases of the colon was also registered by the GP. For the final diagnosis, the patients underwent either a colonoscopy or a barium enema.

We carried out coronary arteriography on fifteen hypertensive patients with LVH and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 3 consecutive ventricular complexes) of whom nine (60%) were free of significant (greater than 50% stenosis) coronary disease. To identify other possible correlates of left ventricular arrhythmias, 28 patients with LVH, comprising 17 with ventricular tachycardia and 11 without ventricular arrhythmias, underwent quantitative assessment of left ventricular function (angiographic ejection fraction), left ventricular mass (echocardiography), and left ventricular fibrosis (endomyocardial biopsy). Ejection fraction was not significantly different between the two groups (53 +/- 8% v 62 +/- 2%, P = NS). However, left ventricular mass was significantly greater (442 +/- 28 g v 339 +/- 34 g, P less than .05) and percentage fibrosis significantly higher (19 +/- 4% v 3 +/- 1%, P less than .001) in those patients with ventricular tachycardia.

Little is known about the mechanism(s) in the development of restenosis after excimer laser angioplasty. Thus, the rationale of this study was to determine the time course of intimal and medial smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and histomorphological changes after experimental excimer laser treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS. Laser ablation was performed in the right carotid artery of 34 New Zealand White rabbits after development of a fibromuscular plaque by repeated weak electrical stimulations. The vessels were excised 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after excimer laser treatment. Staining of alpha-actin was used to identify SMCs. In five rabbits (15%), a stenosis of more than 50% of luminal area was due to intimal proliferation of SMCs, and in four other rabbits, a total occlusion was due to organized thrombi. After the initial ablation of the performed plaque (13 +/- 6 intimal SMC layers) a continuous increase of intimal wall thickness was found from 7 +/- 6 SMC layers at 7 days to 28 +/- 5 intimal SMC layers at 28 days after excimer laser ablation (p less than 0.01). After 42 days, no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred. After bromodeoxyuridine labeling, the extent of cell proliferation (percent of cells undergoing DNA synthesis) in the intima and media was determined using a monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine. Immunohistological quantification of SMC proliferation in the intima revealed a significant increase of cells undergoing DNA synthesis at 3 (p less than 0.05) and 14 (p less than 0.01) days after laser treatment. Medial proliferation of SMCs was delayed and had a significant increase 7 days (p less than 0.05) after intervention. Twenty-one days after laser treatment, SMC proliferation in the intima as well as in the media was normalized. CONCLUSIONS. The proliferative response of SMCs after experimental excimer laser treatment will occur as a dynamic process with a maximum of SMCs undergoing DNA synthesis during 14 days after laser ablation, resulting in an increase of intimal thickening within 4 weeks after laser treatment. The extent of intimal hyperplasia due to SMC proliferation after excimer laser treatment is comparable with the effect of transluminal balloon angioplasty in this experimental model. ',\n",
       " '719': 'Endothelium-derived relaxing factors. A perspective from in vivo data. We review below published studies of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in vivo. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been demonstrated in conduit arteries in vivo and in the cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, and femoral vascular beds as well as in the microcirculation of the brain and the microcirculation of cremaster muscle. The available evidence, although not complete, strongly suggests that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by acetylcholine in the cerebral microcirculation is a nitrosothiol. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by bradykinin in this vascular bed is an oxygen radical generated in association with enhanced arachidonate metabolism via cyclooxygenase. In the microcirculation of skeletal muscle, on the other hand, the vasodilation from bradykinin is mediated partly by prostacyclin and partly by an endothelium-derived relaxing factor similar to that generated by acetylcholine. Basal secretion of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is controversial in vivo but is usually present in vitro. On the other hand, it appears that endothelium-derived relaxing factor mediates flow-dependent vasodilation in both large vessels and in the microcirculation in vivo. The generation and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from endothelium may be abnormal in a variety of conditions including acute and chronic hypertension, atherosclerosis, and ischemia followed by reperfusion. Several mechanisms for these abnormalities have been identified. These include inability to generate endothelium-derived relaxing factor or destruction of endothelium-derived relaxing factor by oxidants after its release in the extracellular space. These abnormalities in endothelium-dependent relaxation may contribute to the vascular abnormalities in these conditions. ',\n",

Mortality rates of approximately 10-30% and amputation rates of the same magnitude in the survivors are repeatedly reported despite advances in medical and surgical techniques. Our experience, which utilized percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolysis as the initial treatment in 72 instances (63 patients), has resulted in a markedly lower mortality rate of 1.6% and a lower amputation rate of 8.5% in the survivors. Careful categorization by clinical degree of ischemia indicates that 82% of the cases were either threatened or irreversible limb ischemia. The initial treatment with thrombolysis did not preclude subsequent prompt surgical treatment when necessary; in these cases, thrombolysis promoted improved surgical results (100%) when it was successful. It markedly reduced the need for urgent surgery, usually simplified the subsequent surgical approach, diminished the overall need for surgery, and often accomplished a successful outcome alone (31%). Significant bleeding was not noted during subsequent surgical procedures and was noted in only 2.8% of the cases. Confirmation of these results and further improvements in technique might justify the use of an initially high-dose urokinase transcatheter infusion regimen as the initial treatment of choice for acute lower-limb ischemia.

       " '723': 'The relevance of anatomic and hemodynamic factors to a classification of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Potential prognostic anatomic and hemodynamic factors were evaluated in 248 patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), all treated by direct microsurgical removal. The size of each AVM was calculated by its volume, obtained by the multiplication of the three AVM diameters by 0.52. A surgical classification of AVM location (in 11 groups) is proposed. Types of feeders and of drainage were classified as superficial or deep; the extent of the drainage system was classified according to a four-degree scale. The mean flow velocity in the main AVM feeder, detected using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, was used as an indirect measure of AVM shunt flow in a small number of patients (n = 29). AVM volume was a very important prognostic factor: the incidence of hyperemic complications and the morbidity and mortality rate were significantly higher when the volume of the lesion was greater than 20 cm3 (P less than 0.0001 for hyperemic complications; P less than 0.001 for permanent morbidity and mortality). The incidence of hyperemic complications and the morbidity rate were higher in AVMs in rolandic, inferior limbic, and insular locations than in AVMs in other locations. As for other anatomic factors: a) the presence of deep feeders significantly increased the incidence of hyperemic complications, as well as the morbidity and mortality rate; b) the presence of deep drainage significantly increased permanent morbidity only; c) the extension of the venous system was significantly related to the development of hyperemic complications, and to morbidity and mortality. Transcranial Doppler examination showed that mean flow velocities greater than 120 cm/s in the main feeder were associated with a significantly higher rate of postoperative hematomas and transient deficits. A classification of cerebral AVMs that takes into account AVM volume and location, the type of feeders, the extent of the drainage system, and the main feeder flow velocity is suggested. ',\n",

Spontaneous perforation of the biliary system is an unusual neonatal phenomenon that is rarely recognized at birth. To date, it has not been reported antenatally. A 16-year-old pregnant adolescent had an ultrasonogram at 25 weeks of pregnancy that revealed ascites in the fetus. After the infant was delivered at 32 weeks, a hepato-iminodiacetic acid scan showed a spontaneous rupture of the common bile duct. The infant was treated with external drainage of the biliary tree and recovered well. This case demonstrates that spontaneous perforations of the bile ducts can occur much earlier than the usually described 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be diagnosed antenatally, and should be added to the list of causes of fetal ascites.

In 1988, 5 patients (3 men and 2 women) with ulcer disease (mean age 56 +/- 8 years) underwent valvular replacement for aortic (No. = 4) or mitral disease (No. = 1). All patients had had gastroduodenal ulcers. Preoperative gastroscopy demonstrated active ulcers (No. = 4) and a healed pyloric ulcer with pyloric stenosis (No. = 1). Despite the presence of ulcers, a non-biologic prosthesis was preferred in each patient because of their young age (No. = 3), chronic atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy (No. = 1), and refusal of the eventuality of subsequent reoperation (No. = 1). In each patient, a truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty was performed simultaneously with the valvular procedures by the same incision. The postoperative courses were uneventful. With a mean follow-up of 15 +/- 3 months, no gastrointestinal bleeding was observed during anticoagulant therapy. With anticoagulant drugs, bleeding may occur with a frequency of 4% per patient treatment-year, half of which are gastrointestinal in origin. Nevertheless, in selected patients with gastroduodenal ulcers, performing a vagotomy-pyloroplasty simultaneously with valvular replacement allows implantation of a non-biologic prosthesis, with greater durability than bioprosthesis.

A suction drain was placed on each patient's right operative wound, while no drains were used on the left. Otherwise, the same operative technique and method of closure were used in all wounds. Statistical analysis of the results showed no difference between the two sides with regard to the incidences of swelling or persistent drainage. Return of active function of the quadriceps and of range of motion of the knee in patients who had had a total knee replacement was also unaffected by the use of suction drains. We concluded that the routine use of suction drains for wounds is unnecessary after uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty. \",\n",

The loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific regions of the human genome in tumor DNA is recognized as evidence for a tumor-suppressor gene located within the corresponding region of the homologous chromosome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a panel of primary human breast tumor DNAs has led to the identification of two additional regions on chromosomes 17q and 18q that frequently are affected by LOH. Deletions of each of these regions have a significant correlation with clinical parameters that are associated with aggressive breast carcinomas. Previous restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of this panel of tumors has uncovered several other frequently occurring mutations. LOH on chromosome 18q frequently occurs in tumors with concomitant LOH of loci on chromosomes 17p and 11p. Similarly, tumors having LOH on 17q also have LOH on chromosomes 1p and 3p. This suggests that certain combinations of mutations may collaborate in the development and malignant progression of breast carcinomas. ',\n",

The relationship between the dose of ACTH and long-term prognosis was investigated in 29 patients. There was no relationship between the daily or total ACTH dosage, provided the dose was greater than 0.015 mg (0.6 IU)/kg/day, and the outcome of seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities; however, ACTH 0.04-0.06 mg (1.6-2.4 IU)/kg/day and a total ACTH dose of 1.1-1.5 mg (44-60 IU)/kg resulted in better mental development than smaller doses of ACTH. Side effects of ACTH increased with dosage. Too small or too large a dose of ACTH does not lead to better mental development.

A series of 34 children with confirmed tuberous sclerosis (TS) were studied prospectively by both EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ages ranging from 5 months to 18 years. Size and topography of the cortical tubers were analyzed on axial and coronal views, in T2 sequences, and the large tubers greater than 10 mm were studied. In addition, EEG follow-up data were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients (76%) had both MRI large cortical tubers and EEG foci, 3 had normal EEG, 2 had normal MRI, and the remaining 3 had only small tubers. The number of large tubers was significantly related to EEG foci. A topographic MRI/EEG correspondence was observed for at least one tuber in 25 of the 26 patients, and correspondence was complete in 10 patients. Large cortical tubers without corresponding EEG foci were observed in 11 patients; these tubers mainly involved the frontal regions and were found before the patients were 2 years old. EEG foci without corresponding tubers were observed in 4 patients. In addition, secondary bilateral synchrony was preferentially observed in patients with frontal lesions and after the age of 2 years. These data confirm that the cortical tubers are epileptogenic and that their expression may be influenced by regional cortical maturation. ',\n",

A patient is described who has features of Pearson syndrome and who presented in the neonatal period with a hypoplastic anemia. He later developed hepatic, renal, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. At the age of 5 years he developed visual impairment, tremor, ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, external ophthalmoplegia, and a pigmentary retinopathy (Kearns-Sayre syndrome). Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. Analysis of mtDNA from leukocytes and muscle showed mtDNA heteroplasmy in both tissues, with one population of mtDNA deleted by 4.9 kb. The deleted region was bridged by a 13-nucleotide sequence occurring as a direct repeat in normal mtDNA. Both Pearson syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome have been noted to be associated with deletions of mtDNA; they have not previously been described in the same patient. These observations indicate that the two disorders have the same molecular basis; the different phenotypes are probably determined by the initial proportion of deleted mtDNAs and modified by selection against them in different tissues.

The authors studied 15 cases treated with radical prostatectomy to define more completely their pathologic features and determine the clinical outcome in these surgically treated patients. The study included morphometry and DNA image analysis using the CAS-200 system. The most common presentation was urinary outlet obstruction (n = 9), and most patients were clinical Stage B with palpable prostatic lesions (n = 12). Compared with acinar cancers of similar clinical stage, duct cancers were large (tumor volume, 8.4 +/- 10.0 cc) and occupied a large portion of the gland (23 +/- 21%). Duct cancers were in an advanced final pathologic stage with 93% having capsular penetration, 47% positive margins, 40% seminal vesicle invasion, and 27% positive pelvic lymph nodes. The DNA analysis on cells disaggregated from paraffin revealed that 54% of cases were diploid, 15% tetraploid, 8% aneuploid, and 23% tetraploid/aneuploid. On clinical follow-up, eight patients had no evidence of tumor at intervals ranging from 1 to 28 months, and seven patients (47%) had persistent tumor at intervals of 3 to 18 months. This study demonstrates that duct cancers are in an advanced pathologic stage by the time of presentation and have a much higher short-term failure rate after radical prostatectomy compared with acinar cancers.

Fifteen abdominal organ systems and 17 physiologic variables in 300 consecutive patients were analyzed to determine ability to predict intraabdominal sepsis. There were no significant differences in predictive ability between the old and new organ risk factors. The addition of physiologic factors did not enhance the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis. This clinical study demonstrates that: 1) the risk of intra-abdominal sepsis increases with increasing ATI score; 2) the previous (1979-initial) organ risk grading concept is statistically valid; 3) six of the 15 organ systems warrant a change in their relative rank order (1989-revision); 4) the addition of demographic, physiologic, and immunologic variables did not significantly improve the prediction of intra-abdominal sepsis.

In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) nicardipine was compared with placebo in the control of postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. One hundred twenty-two patients (17 cardiac and 105 noncardiac surgery) met the entry criteria (systolic BP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) and were randomized (3:2) to receive IV nicardipine (n = 71) or placebo (n = 51). Therapeutic response (greater than or equal to 15 percent reduction in BP from baseline) was achieved in 94 percent of patients treated with IV nicardipine vs 12 percent with placebo (p less than 0.001). The mean response time and infusion rate for IV nicardipine were 11.5 (+/- 0.8) minutes and 12.8 (+/- 0.3) mg/h, respectively. The magnitude of BP reduction was similar in both cardiac and noncardiac postsurgical patients. Blood pressure control was sustained with minimal dose adjustments of IV nicardipine (3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/h) during a prolonged maintenance infusion period of 6.8 +/- 0.5 h. A reflex mean increase in heart rate of 5 bpm was seen in patients treated with IV nicardipine. Sixteen patients (15 noncardiac and one cardiac surgery) had a sustained heart rate of greater than 100 bpm, with a mean increase of 24 bpm from the baseline. In all these patients except three, tachycardia was resolved while receiving nicardipine. None of these patients who had development of tachycardia during nicardipine therapy had exhibited ST segment changes indicative of ischemia. One patient with tachycardia at baseline had exhibited ST segment depression (3 to 4 mm) during nicardipine treatment, which was resolved following discontinuation of nicardipine therapy and application of nitroglycerin (Nitropaste). Hemodynamic evaluation revealed that IV nicardipine significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and significantly increased cardiac index with no change in heart rate. These hemodynamic changes were similar in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. Adverse experiences reported with IV nicardipine included hypotension (4.5 percent), tachycardia (2.7 percent), and nausea/vomiting (4.5 percent). In the placebo group, the incidence of adverse experience was 6 percent, with an equal distribution of hypotension (2 percent), nausea/vomiting (2 percent), and headache (2 percent). No clinically important changes in laboratory variables related to IV nicardipine were reported. In conclusion, these findings indicate that nicardipine, a titratable intravenous calcium channel blocker, can rapidly and effectively control postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients.

Alkaline reflux gastritis and the symptoms associated with alkaline reflux gastritis have been reported in the medical literature since shortly after Billroth successfully performed his first gastrectomy in the 1880s. The disease process is produced by, or at least is associated with, the reflux of alkaline secretions into the gastric remnant. Although it occurs after any procedure that ablates the pylorus including pyloroplasty, it would appear to be most common after a Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. How the alkaline secretions cause the gastritis is still controversial. Clearly, the most effective therapy is to reroute the secretions from the biliary tract, pancreas, and duodenum so that they will not reflux into the gastric remnant. This is most effectively accomplished by a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy with the afferent limb measuring at least 18 inches (40 cm). The surgeon and the patient should be aware that the construction of such a gastric outlet channel is associated with delayed gastric emptying. The etiology of this impaired emptying is also controversial. If the patient has symptoms of dumping (either early or late), these symptoms may also be abated using the Roux limb. At least 40% of patients will have gastric outlet obstruction. Supportive therapy is appropriate in the majority of these patients. ',\n",

In this study, we evaluated this ubiquitin hybrid protein gene expression in surgical specimens of colon cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that ubiquitin hybrid protein messenger RNA was overexpressed in primary colon cancers compared with adjacent normal colon mucosae in 17 of 20 patients. Dot blot analysis of RNA of 27 tumor samples revealed significantly greater expression in higher Dukes' stage primary colon tumors and liver metastases.

The authors used retrospective quantitative DNA analysis to study interrelationships between multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas in seven patients. DNA content was determined by image analysis on Feulgen-stained nuclear smears prepared from multiple paraffin blocks from each tumor. Tumors were unilateral in four cases and bilateral in three. Ten tumors had homogeneous, and four heterogeneous DNA stemlines. Intertumoral heterogeneity in four cases suggested multifocal origin. Identical DNA aneuploid indices in bilateral tumors in one case suggested metastasis from a solitary origin. Abnormal DNA content and heterogeneous populations began to appear in the size range 2.0 to 5.0 cm. All tumors over 5.0 cm contained nondiploid populations. Although the interrelationships between these multiple synchronous neoplasms are not entirely clear, the DNA analysis suggests that the occurrence of nondiploid stemlines and heterogeneous DNA content may parallel both tumor growth and more aggressive behavior.

With these clones we were able to identify and characterize eight deletions in 69 choroideremia patients investigated. The deletions are heterogeneous, in both size and location. The smallest deletion (patient LGL1134) comprises approximately 45 kb of DNA, whereas the largest ones (patients 25.6 and LGL2905) span a DNA segment of at least 5 megabases, which is comparable in size to the smallest deletion detected in a TCD patient (patient XL45) showing a complex phenotype. The TCD deletions encompass variable parts of 150-200-kb DNA segment that is flanked by p1bD5 (DXS165) at the centromeric side and by pZ 11 at the telomeric side. The deletions in patients 33.1, LGL1101, and LGl1134 do not span a translocation breakpoint which was previously mapped on the X chromosome of a female with TCD.

From March 1988 through June 1989, 70 women had two consecutive smears reported as IA; all underwent colposcopy and cervical biopsy. In 58 patients (83%) the biopsies and smears obtained during colposcopy were negative for condyloma and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Ten patients (14%) had condylomas, and two (3%) had condylomas with CIN (one CIN I and one II).

Balloon valvuloplasty was immediately successful in all five newborns, as evidenced by a decrease in valve gradient and improvement in left ventricular function and cardiac output. Peak systolic gradient was reduced by 64% from 69 +/- 8 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg (p = 0.005). Left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 128 +/- 9 to 95 +/- 9 mm Hg (p = 0.02) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 20 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 1 mm Hg (p = 0.02).

Observations presented suggest that the interchange of the Mg++ ion between the cerebrospinal fluid, extracellular fluid, and bone is more rapid and dynamic than is usually believed. This is especially so when the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is associated with significant skeletal depletion of Mg++ as judged by history rather than serum level. Magnesium, much like calcium, has a large presence in bone and has a negative feedback relationship with the parathyroid gland. A decline in central nervous system Mg++ may occur when the skeletal buffer system orchestrated largely by the parathyroid glands is activated by an increase in serum calcium. Observations in veterinary medicine and obstetrics suggest that the transfer of Mg++ from the extracellular fluid into bone during mineralization processes may be extensive. If the inhibition of the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is prolonged and the skeletal depletion of Mg++ extreme, serious neurologic symptoms, including seizures, coma, and death, may occur. Noise, excitement, and bodily contact appear to precipitate neurologic symptoms in Mg+(+)-deficient human subjects as it has been documented to occur in Mg+(+)-deficient experimental animals.

Variable results have been reported after medical and surgical management. Twenty female patients with Takayasu's arteritis were treated from 1973 to 1989. Eleven (55%) patients had hypertension. Upper or lower extremity ischemia was present in 12 (60%) patients and cerebrovascular insufficiency in seven (35%). Nine patients initially managed with corticosteroids had no improvement in signs or symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Eleven patients had 16 vascular procedures for the following indications: renovascular hypertension (6), extremity ischemia (5), cerebrovascular insufficiency (2), dilation ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency (1), thoracic aortic aneurysm (1), abdominal aortic aneurysm (1). Procedures included aortorenal bypass (5), carotid-subclavian, axillary, or brachial bypass (4), aorto-carotid bypass (2), aneurysm resection (2), supra-celiac aorto-femoral bypass (1), ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (1), and nephrectomy (1). Clinical improvement occurred in all patients. There were no operative deaths. All are alive at a mean follow-up of 5.75 years (6 months to 16 years). Revision of the initial reconstruction has been required for recurrent renovascular hypertension in one patient and extremity ischemia in another. The other nine patients remain symptomatically improved. Symptomatic Takayasu's arteritis frequently requires arterial reconstruction.

The mean follow-up was 3.1 years. Most patients with incomplete neurologic lesions showed postoperative improvement and were upgraded one or two steps in the Frankel scale. No patient showed neurologic deterioration after surgery. In all patients, bony union occurred. Loss of reduction of more than 5 degrees occurred in 41% of the patients. Because of this high rate of loss of reduction in patients and the low degree of flexion-bending loading and torsional stability in biomechanical evaluation in vitro of the Slot-Zielke device on human cadaveric spines, an additional posterior stabilization of the spine after an anterior approach for anterior- and middle-column fractures should be considered.

The study objective was to determine what effect the replacement of bleomycin with VP-16 has on complete response (CR), survival, and drug toxicity. One hundred sixty-nine patients were registered and randomized. Of these patients, 160 were assessable for response. All had histologically confirmed disseminated germ cell neoplasms of testicular origin. Forty-six had minimal metastatic disease, and 114 had maximal disease. Seventy-seven were randomized to PVB and 83 to VPV chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in pretreatment characteristics between the two arms with regard to tumor burden, histologic type, and overall performance status. Patients received four courses of induction chemotherapy, either PVB (cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, vinblastine 12 mg/m2 day 1, bleomycin 15 U/m2 twice per week) or VPV (vinblastine 8 mg/m2 day 1, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, VP-16 50 mg/m2 days 2 to 5). Chemotherapy was given every 3 weeks. Cytoreductive surgery was done postinduction if a chemotherapy CR was not achieved. There was no difference in the percentage of patients achieving a disease-free status between PVB (77%) and VPV (73%). The mean leukocyte nadir was similar for both treatments, but the mean platelet nadir was significantly lower (P = .003) in the VPV arm. All bleomycin-related toxicities (pulmonary, mucositis, skin) were avoided in the VPV arm. We conclude that bleomycin can be replaced in first-line therapy for advanced germ cell tumors without sacrificing efficacy and with the advantage of avoiding unnecessary drug toxicity. ',\n",

The prevalence and characteristics of transient myocardial ischaemia were studied in 203 patients with recent acute myocardial infarction by both early (6.4 days) and late (38 days) ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment. Transient ST segment depression was much commoner during late (32% patients) than early (14%) monitoring. Most transient ischaemia (greater than 85% episodes) was silent and 80% of patients had only silent episodes. During late monitoring painful ST depression was accompanied by greater ST depression and tended to occur at a higher heart rate. Late transient ischaemia showed a diurnal distribution, occurred at a higher initial heart rate, and was more often accompanied by a further increase in heart rate than early ischaemia. Thus in the first 2 months after myocardial infarction transient ischaemia became increasingly common and more closely associated with increased myocardial oxygen demand. Because transient ischaemic episodes during early and late ambulatory monitoring have dissimilar characteristics they may also have different pathophysiologies and prognostic implications. ',\n",

Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown definitely to reduce the incidence of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and nonfatal reinfarction in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction. The mechanisms to explain this protective action of beta blockers have never been elucidated conclusively, and include the antiarrhythmic and myocardial oxygen demand-reducing effects of the drugs. An antithrombotic mechanism has also been suggested. However, beta blockers have relatively weak antiplatelet activity, suggesting that their antithrombotic effects may be related to prevention of coronary artery plaque rupture and the subsequent propagation of an occlusive arterial thrombus rather than direct anticoagulant action. The therapeutic ability of beta blockers to attenuate the hemodynamic consequences of catecholamine surges, may protect a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque from fracture, thereby reducing risk of coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction and death.

The initial defect contrasts and myocardial-to-lung ratios were similar by both agents but myocardial-to-liver ratio was lower by [123I]MPDA at 5 min, which became similar to 201Tl at 5 hr. Normal percent myocardial clearances of both agents were comparable and significantly higher than those in defect zones. Thus [123I]MPDA is suitable for myocardial imaging and correlates closely with 201Tl for initial postexercise myocardial uptake and defect reversibility.

Because of the large differential diagnosis, many diagnostic tests are available for its evaluation. However, a cause of syncope is not established in 38% to 47% of patients despite these tests. In those patients in whom a diagnosis can be assigned, the history and physical examination identify a potential cause in 49% to 85%. Furthermore, in 8% of additional patients, history and physical examination are suggestive of causes that need confirmation by specific tests. Routine blood tests rarely yield diagnostically helpful information. In those patients in whom a potential cause for syncope is identified, arrhythmias are diagnosed by electrocardiogram in 2% to 11% of patients, cardiac monitoring in 3% to 27% (telemetry or Holter), stress test in less than 1%, carotid massage in less than 1%, and electrophysiologic studies in less than 3%. Diagnosis of arrhythmias as a cause of syncope is problematic because symptomatic correlation during electrocardiographic monitoring is rarely found (approximately 4%), and as a result, there is no uniform agreement on diagnostic criteria for abnormalities. Similar problems exist in the use of electrophysiologic studies. Upright tilt testing and psychiatric examination may be useful in evaluation of recurrent syncope of unknown cause in patients without organic heart disease. Based on the results of recent studies, strategies for evaluation of patients with syncope are possible that utilize selective and goal-directed diagnostic testing. ',\n",

Intragastric ethanol stimulates mucosal formation of leukotriene C4 in the rat stomach. The present study demonstrates that the increase in leukotriene C4 formation begins within 30 seconds and is maximal within 5 minutes, closely paralleled by the appearance of hemorrhagic lesions. Leukotriene C4 formation returns to prechallenge levels within 3 hours, although erosions still persist. Intragastric 0.2N NaOH, acidified 100 mmol/L taurocholate, 25% NaCl, or 0.6N HCl did not consistently increase leukotriene C4 formation despite severe mucosal injury. A number of sulfhydryl-containing or sulfhydryl-blocking agents as well as metals protected against mucosal damage and simultaneously prevented the stimulation of leukotriene C4 formation induced by ethanol. None of the agents increased and some virtually abolished mucosal formation of prostaglandin E2, indicating that gastroprotection can occur completely independently of the endogenous prostaglandin system. The leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886 markedly suppressed gastric leukotriene C4 formation but did not protect against damage caused by ethanol, NaOH, NaCl, or acidified taurocholate. Oral indomethacin reduced the ex vivo formation of both prostaglandin E2 and, to a lesser extent, leukotriene C4 in the gastric mucosa, inducing a shift in the balance from protective prostaglandins to proulcerogenic leukotriene C4. Pretreatment with MK-886, however, did not significantly diminish indomethacin-induced lesions. These data suggest that leukotriene C4 is not the exclusive mediator of gastric injury caused by necrotizing agents or indomethacin. On the other hand, certain protective compounds exhibit a striking parallelism between protection and inhibition of ethanol-induced leukotriene C4 formation, suggesting that they may affect a target crucial for both mucosal injury and stimulation of 5-lipoxygenase.

One hundred AKFP bypasses were done with PTFE and 100 with dacron. In the 30 day postoperative period, four PTFE and three dacron grafts occluded without consequence and only one patient died. Analysis of results by the life-table method demonstrated statistically similar primary graft patency rates at five years (PTFE 65% SE +/- 6.5, dacron 57% +/- 6.2) and ten years (PTFE 31% +/- 18/9, dacron 32% +/- 13.2) (p greater than 0.10). Redo procedures (e.g., thrombectomy, angioplasty) were necessary on 21 grafts (12 PTFE, 9 dacron) and \"secondary\" patency rates at five years were 76% PTFE and 62% dacron; no grafts which required a redo procedure were patent at ten year follow-up. Major amputations during ten year follow-up were necessary in 16 (8%) patients; all amputations were in diabetic patients. Survival rates were 79% at five and 42% at ten years. An anticipated, the leading cause of death was cardiac related (25 patients); 28 (14%) patients underwent aortocoronary bypass during follow-up. A prosthetic AKFP bypass graft is a safe and durable operation which provides relief from the symptoms of intermittent claudication while allowing for the preservation of the saphenous vein for use later in the coronary or infrapopliteal circulations, should the need arise.

We combined the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor metyrosine in an attempt to better manage the hypertension of patients with pheochromocytoma undergoing surgical resection. This report reviews the cases of 25 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for known intra-abdominal pheochromocytoma. Each patient had elevated serum or urine levels of catecholamines or their metabolites. Nineteen patients were prepared before operation with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine and six patients were given phenoxybenzamine alone. There were no significant differences in maximum, minimum, or mean blood pressure before or after tumor resection between patients who received metyrosine and those who did not. However careful review suggested that those who received metyrosine had more severe disease as judged by biochemical criteria. Study of selected patients matched for age and severity of disease suggested that the intraoperative blood pressure management of patients prepared with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine was facilitated. In addition metyrosine-prepared patients lost less blood and required less volume replacement during surgery than did non-metyrosine-prepared patients. There were no apparent differences in postoperative fluid requirements. Although the study is not a prospective randomized trial, a retrospective review of patients managed with the combination of phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine suggests that surgery to resect pheochromocytoma can be better performed with both drugs than with phenoxybenzamine alone. The combination regimen appears to result in better blood pressure control, less blood loss, and the need for less intraoperative fluid replacement than does the traditional method of single-agent alpha-adrenergic blockade.

Restenosis was found in 43 of 140 dilated lesions (31%) and in 41 of 94 patients (44%). Thirty-three (35%) patients had new or progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site. New or progressive lesions occurred with similar frequency in the arteries that did not have angioplasty (23/155 = 15%) as in the arteries that did (13/127 = 10%; chi-square n.s.). In the arteries which underwent angioplasty, new or progressive lesions occurred as commonly proximal to the PTCA site (7/14, 50%) as distal (6/13, 46%). New or progressive lesions occurred in 29% of patients with concomitant restenosis, and 40% of those without restenosis (chi-square n.s.). No clinical, angiographic, or procedural factors distinguished patients with new and progressive lesions in target vessels from those without these lesions in target vessels. Patients with progressive lesions anywhere in the coronary tree were more likely to have had a shorter duration of anginal symptoms before angioplasty and a family history of coronary disease when compared with patients without progressive atherosclerosis. In conclusion, new and progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site occur after the procedure but appear unrelated to the restenosis process or traumatic injury by angioplasty instrumentation.

However, the use of the guidelines may be problematic because individuals may have total cholesterol levels in the desirable range but low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels considered at high risk. This study evaluates the ability of the NCEP screening recommendations to identify correctly persons at high risk of CHD because of lipid abnormalities. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using the NCEP guidelines, we simulated a population-based screening program with data from visits 1 and 2 of the Lipid Research Clinics Program Prevalence Study. Individuals were considered to be at high risk of CHD if they had LDL levels greater than 160 mg/dl or HDL levels less than 35 mg/dl. Following the NCEP process, 21% of those with high LDL concentrations and 66% of those with low HDL concentrations would not be routinely referred for immediate treatment. Overall, 41% of those at high risk of CHD would not be promptly evaluated. The sensitivity of the guidelines for promptly identifying individuals with lipoprotein abnormalities is 59%. CONCLUSIONS. This relatively low sensitivity of total cholesterol as a screening tool should be the impetus for rethinking the screening guidelines. Specifically, the cost-benefit ratio of routine screening for lipoproteins, particularly HDL cholesterol, needs to be carefully considered. \",\n",

Secondary haemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of cases and was not associated with a worsening of final visual acuity. There were no identifiable risk factors for secondary haemorrhage. Poor visual outcome was in most cases attributable to retinal pathology. The use of antifibrinolytic agents does not appear to be necessary in such a population, and the importance of detecting associated retinal detachment is emphasised. ',\n",

Peliosis hepatis is characterized by cystic, blood-filled spaces in the liver and is seen in patients with chronic infections or advanced cancer and as a consequence of therapy with anabolic steroids. Cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infection that occurs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; its histologic appearance is that of a pseudoneoplastic vascular proliferation. METHODS. We studied liver tissue from eight HIV-infected patients with peliosis hepatis, two of whom also had cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. For comparison we examined tissue from four patients who had peliosis hepatis without HIV infection. Tissues were examined histologically on routine sections and with special stains and electron microscopy. RESULTS. The histologic features seen in peliosis hepatis associated with HIV infection, but not in the four cases unrelated to HIV infection, were myxoid stroma and clumps of a granular purple material that on Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy proved to be bacilli. The bacilli, which could not be cultured, were morphologically identical to those found in the skin lesions of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. The clinical courses of two of the patients with this \"bacillary peliosis hepatis\" indicate that it responds to antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS. HIV-associated bacillary peliosis hepatis is an unusual, treatable opportunistic infection, probably caused by the same organism that causes cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis. Our failure to find bacilli in non-HIV-associated cases implies that other pathogenetic mechanisms may also be responsible for peliosis hepatis. ',\n",

Push-enteroscopy using a disinfected colonoscope was performed on 39 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of obscure origin. Our results show that: (1) A high percentage of patients (38%) have pathological lesions responsible for bleeding located in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum, which are readily detected by push-enteroscopy. (2) Duodeno-jejunal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common cause for bleeding, and these lesions can be conveniently cauterized through the endoscope. (3) An efficient sequence of steps for diagnosis of patients with this problem includes push-enteroscopy when the initial EGD and colonoscopy are normal followed by small bowel radiography. Mesenteric angiography and intraoperative enteroscopy can be reserved for patients with severe bleeding when push-enteroscopy and small bowel radiography are negative.

Guanine ribonucleosides, substituted at the C8 position with either a bromine or a thiol group, have recently been shown to regulate several immunologic responses. We have previously shown that 8-mercaptoguanosine (8MG) can replace the requirement for cytokines in the generation of MHC-restricted CTL. In this paper, we examined the ability of 8MG to induce MHC-nonrestricted killer cells. We found that 8MG did not induce significant lytic activity from normal resting lymphocytes. However, 8MG was able to synergize with minimal amounts of IL-2 in inducing lytic activity similar to lymphokine-activated killers (LAK) in that both NK-sensitive and NK-resistant tumor cells were killed. Both the precursors and effectors of 8MG-LAK activity were similar to NK cells and were CD4- CD8- asialo-GM1+ NK1.1+. Similar to IL-2-induced LAK, 8MG-LAK were B220+. 8MG appeared to \"stage\" these precursor lymphocytes to become more responsive to IL-2 because optimal induction of 8MG-LAK required preincubation with 8MG before the addition of IL-2. This \"staging\" appeared to be due to the release of a \"second signal\" since it was readily inhibited by cyclosporine A. Anti-IFN-alpha beta was as efficient as cyclosporine A in inhibiting 8MG-LAK generation, whereas anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-1 did not exhibit significant inhibition. These findings suggest that 8MG can be of possible utility as an IL-2-sparing agent in LAK generation from NK cells. ',\n",

The rapidity of postpartum disease recovery for severe preeclampsia associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome) has not been well studied. Between January 1980 and March 1989, 158 pregnancies with preeclampsia-eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome were managed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The 70 patients with platelet nadir below 50,000/microL (class 1 HELLP syndrome) required as long as 11 days for all members to achieve a platelet recovery concentration of more than 100,000/microL, whereas all 88 gravidas with platelet nadir between 50,000-100,000/microL (class 2 HELLP syndrome) exceeded this platelet concentration by the sixth postpartum day, a statistically significant difference (P less than .0001). The interval between delivery and the onset of diuresis (mean +/- SD) was significantly longer in class 1 than in class 2 patients with milder disease (22.7 +/- 18.9 compared with 15.9 +/- 11.1 hours). Significantly more postpartum days were required in class 1 than in class 2 HELLP parturients for the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration to decrease below 500 IU/L (4.2 +/- 4.9 compared with 3.2 +/- 2.7 days). No women in the class 2 group required plasma exchange therapy to effect disease arrest and reversal, but 11 of 58 severely ill women in class 1 were treated with this modality. We conclude that the platelet count and LDH serum concentration, as indicators of HELLP severity and recovery, are clinically useful tools and that a more protracted postpartum recovery period should be expected for progressively severe expressions of HELLP syndrome.

DESIGN--Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study. SETTING--Hospital outpatient clinics in Edinburgh. SUBJECTS--Twenty clinically stable patients (13 women, seven men) with nocturnal asthma, median age 39 (range 18-60) years. INTERVENTIONS--Salmeterol 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms and placebo taken each morning and evening by metered dose inhaler. Rescue salbutamol inhalers were provided throughout the run in and study periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Improvement in nocturnal asthma as measured by peak expiratory flow rates and change in sleep quality as measured by electroencephalography. RESULTS--Salmeterol improved the lowest overnight peak flow rate at both 50 micrograms (difference in median values (95% confidence interval for difference in medians) 69 (18 to 88) l/min) and 100 micrograms (72 (23 to 61) l/min) doses twice daily. While taking salmeterol 50 micrograms twice daily patients had an objective improvement in sleep quality, spending less time awake or in light sleep (-9 (-4 to -44) min) and more time in stage 4 sleep (26 (6-34) min).

On day 9 of infection, the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125 +/- 19 mg in the control group versus 102 +/- 14 mg in the captopril group (p less than 0.0003). Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5% (2.0% to 7.5%) in the placebo group versus 2.0% (0.0% to 5.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01).

From 1977 to 1987, 829 Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valves (Shiley, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) were implanted in 766 patients at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. There were 476 patients who had aortic valve replacement, 234 who had mitral valve replacement, and 44 who had double valve replacement. The standard-profile design was used in 508 patients and the low-profile design in 321 patients. Follow-up was obtained for 97% of patients, with calculation of event-free probabilities. At 10 years the overall probability of freedom from structural failure was 48% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 44% +/- 15% after mitral valve replacement, and 79% +/- 11% after double valve replacement. Although at 5 years the probability of failure was statistically lower with the low-profile design, this favorability was lost by 6 years. Freedom from structural failure was only 47% +/- 7% for the standard-profile valve at 10 years. Thus the probability of freedom from reoperation was only 46% +/- 7% after aortic valve replacement, 39% +/- 6% after mitral valve replacement, and 65% +/- 20% after double valve replacement at 10 years. Thromboembolism occurred in 69 patients, for a predicted freedom from this complication at 10 years of 79% +/- 3% after aortic, 73% +/- 7% after mitral, and 96% +/- 4% after double valve replacement. There were 31 cases of endocarditis. The 10-year predicted freedom from endocarditis, therefore, was 86% +/- 3% after aortic, 98% +/- 1% after mitral, and 97% +/- 1% after double valve replacement. A total of 221 operative and late deaths were recorded in this series. Prosthetic valve failure accounted for 27% of late deaths.

A total of 648 arterial segments were measured, yielding a highly significant correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined cross-sectional area (r = 0.96, p = 0.0001). Similarly, a highly significant linear relation was observed between videodensitometry and caliper-determined diameter (r = 0.95, p = 0.0001). When data subsets for small, medium and large arterial segments were examined, higher variability in the correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined area was observed in the large segments (greater than 10 mm2). In addition, caliper-estimated areas tended to be slightly smaller than videodensitometry-estimated areas in these segments. For diameter estimations, correlations between caliper and videodensitometry data were similar for the entire range of arterial segment sizes. Intra- and interobserver variability was low for both caliper and videodensitometry determination of diameter or area. Thus, over a wide range of arterial dimensions, results obtained with caliper estimates of luminal area and diameter are comparable to those obtained with videodensitometry using the XR-70 system.

       " '799': 'Percutaneous support devices for high risk or complicated coronary angioplasty. Indications for coronary angioplasty have expanded to include patients with unstable acute ischemic syndromes, severe multivessel coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function. Several mechanical approaches have been developed as adjuncts to high risk coronary angioplasty to improve patient tolerance of coronary balloon occlusion and maintain hemodynamic stability in the event of complications. These percutaneous techniques include intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, anterograde transcatheter coronary perfusion, coronary sinus retroperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, Hemopump left ventricular assistance and partial left heart bypass. The intraaortic balloon pump provides hemodynamic support and ameliorates ischemia by decreasing myocardial work; it may be inserted for periprocedural complications or before angioplasty in patients with ischemia or hypotension. Anterograde distal coronary artery perfusion may be accomplished passively through an autoperfusion catheter or by active pumping of oxygenated blood or fluorocarbons through the central lumen of an angioplasty catheter. Synchronized coronary sinus retroperfusion produces pulsatile blood flow via the cardiac veins to the coronary bed distal to a stenosis. Both perfusion techniques limit development of ischemic chest pain and myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing prolonged balloon inflations. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass provides complete systemic hemodynamic support which is independent of intrinsic cardiac function or rhythm and has been employed prophylactically in very high risk patients before coronary angioplasty or emergently for abrupt closure. These and newer support devices, while associated with significant complications, may ultimately improve the safety of coronary angioplasty and allow its application to those who would otherwise not be candidates for revascularization.

Evolution of surgical techniques for repair of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture initially involved differentiation of these lesions from prior experience with surgical approaches to congenital ventricular septal defects, which were in the main not applicable. Second, understanding of the differing anatomical locations of postinfarction ventricular septal defects required innovation in terms of the location of the cardiotomy and type of repair necessary to achieve a successful result in any given patient. The gradual appreciation of different clinical courses pursued by patients after postinfarction ventricular septal rupture both in terms of location of the defect and the degree of right ventricular functional impairment has led to increased urgency relative to the timing of surgical repair.

Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models.

The VEP is based on electrical information recorded from the visual cortex in response to stimulation of the retina. Thus, the integrity of the entire visual pathway can be tested. Localizing ability of the VEP is limited. Since the visual cortex is heavily weighted by representation of the central retina, peripheral lesions, including those producing peripheral visual field abnormalities that do not impinge upon central fixation, may produce relatively little disturbance of the VEP. As with most tests, electrophysiologic studies of the visual system must be placed in context of the entire examination, including the patient's history and neurologic and especially neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation. Electrophysiologic testing has three main uses in neurology.

A cAMP response element (CRE) has been identified in the proximal 5'-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene, and activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway in fetal rat intestinal cells leads to an increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts. In contrast, the human glucagon gene does not contain a similar CRE, and the results of studies using immortalized rat and hamster islet cell lines have suggested that glucagon gene expression may not be regulated by cAMP. To reconcile these observations, we have studied the control of glucagon gene expression. Incubation of primary rat islet cell cultures with forskolin in the presence of low (0.5 g/liter) or high (2.0 g/L) glucose resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in the levels of glucagon mRNA transcripts. Forskolin also stimulated the secretion and synthesis of immunoreactive glucagon. The importance of the protein kinase-A-dependent pathway in the regulation of glucagon gene expression was also examined in hamster islet InR1-G9 cells.

Of 159 patients randomized at Westmead Hospital to the multicenter Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) after streptokinase and aspirin in acute myocardial infarction, 87 underwent electrophysiologic testing 6 to 28 days after infarction to determine their risk of subsequent ventricular arrhythmias (streptokinase 20 patients; aspirin 25 patients; streptokinase and aspirin 21 patients; both placebos 21 patients). Patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing had similar clinical characteristics to those of patients who did not. The stimulation protocol comprised up to and including four extrastimuli applied to the right ventricular apex at twice diastolic threshold. An abnormal result was defined as ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length greater than or equal to 230 ms lasting greater than or equal to 10 s. Ventricular tachycardia was inducible at electrophysiologic study in 8 patients who received placebo streptokinase, but in no patient who received active streptokinase (8 of 46 versus 0 of 41; p = 0.005, Fischer's exact test). Ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 4 patients who received aspirin therapy and 4 who did not (4 of 41 versus 4 of 46; p = NS). During a mean follow-up period of 39 +/- 9 months, there were no spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or witnessed sudden death in the streptokinase-treated group compared with three such events in the placebo-treated group (p = 0.13). When compared with placebo therapy, intravenous streptokinase substantially reduced the incidence of inducible ventricular tachycardia in infarct survivors. No similar benefit was attributable to aspirin therapy. \",\n",
       " '810': 'Post-traumatic intracerebral pneumatocele: case report. Pneumocephalus occurs in 0.5 to 1.0% of head trauma, but may also occur after neurologic surgery, or as a result of eroding infection or neoplasm. The pathophysiology involves the presence of craniodural fistula allowing ingress of air. A ball-valve mechanism may allow air to enter but not exit the cranium, or CSF leak permits air entrance as fluid leaves the intracranial space. While a \"succession splash\" is considered diagnostic of pneumocephalus, most patients have nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headache. Therefore, a high index of suspicion in a patient with recent head trauma is necessary. The diagnosis is made radiographically by CT scan. This is generally performed to rule out intracranial hematoma or cerebral contusion in head trauma, but will reveal even very small quantities of air to the unsuspecting physician. Therapy is often noninvasive, allowing the craniodural defect to heal spontaneously. Selected situations require immediate operative repair of the fistula. ',\n",

High-frequency transvaginal probes were used at 20-40 weeks' gestation to develop a systematic examination of the fetal brain. Modeling the procedure after the standard neonatal neurosonographic examination, we attempted to obtain three coronal sections (anterior, midline, posterior) and two sagittal sections (midsagittal, right or left parasagittal). In 70 normal patients, all planes were imaged with a similar frequency (74-76%) except for the posterior coronal plane, which was imaged 59% of the time. Among the first 35 cases, 17% had a complete study, compared with 71% of the second 35 cases. Transvaginal sonography established or changed the diagnosis in five of the 13 cases with central nervous system or other abnormalities.

Of 153 patients presenting with acute transient amnesia, 114 fulfilled the proposed strict diagnostic criteria for transient global amnesia (TGA). The prognosis of this group was excellent with the exception of a small subgroup (7%), largely identifiable because of atypically brief or recurrent attacks, who developed epilepsy of temporal lobe type on follow up. Computerised tomography (CT) scans performed on 95 patients were normal, evidence for covert alcoholism was lacking and there was a familial incidence of approximately 2%. By contrast, the group of 39 patients who did not meet the criteria for TGA had a significantly worse prognosis with a high incidence of major vascular events. The groups could not be distinguished on the basis of behavioural characteristics during the attack. The following classification was proposed: 1) pure TGA--attacks fulfilling the strict criteria, and of more than one hour in duration which do not require detailed investigation, 2) probable epileptic amnesia--attacks of less than an hour or rapidly recurrent, 3) probable transient ischaemic amnesia, a minority of cases with additional focal neurological deficits during the attack.

       " '813': 'When is a prognostic factor useful? A guide for the perplexed. Traditionally, a number of variables have been used to predict outcome in patients with early-stage breast cancer. These tests are simple to perform and relatively inexpensive. Recently, a number of new factors, eg, tumor proliferative index, nuclear DNA content, and amplification or overexpression of growth-promoting genes or oncogenes have been identified as potential predictors of outcome in patients with breast cancer. There is now increasing pressure to introduce such tests into routine clinical practice. How does a clinical practitioner identify which test, or group of tests, best predicts adverse outcome and whether any more clinically useful information is provided than with the use of more traditional factors alone? The aim of a prognostic test in breast cancer is to predict which patients are destined to develop a recurrence of cancer and those who are not. The prognostic usefulness of a test can be expressed in terms of relative risk (RR), which is the ratio of the risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients who test positive to the risk in those who test negative. Methodologic guidelines that should be satisfied by a study evaluating the predictive ability of a test include the following: (1) Was an inception cohort assembled? (2) Was the referral pattern described? (3) Were laboratory and clinical outcomes assessed in a blinded fashion? (4) Was complete follow-up achieved? (5) Was adjustment for extraneous prognostic factors carried out? (6) Were appropriate statistical methods used? An approach is suggested to help the clinician choose the test, or combination of tests, likely to discriminate between \"high-\" and \"low-risk\" patients in his/her own practice. The decision regarding what particular threshold value (risk) defined by a prognostic test (or series of tests) warrants adjuvant therapy for an individual patient is a complex one but should be based on a clear presentation of the risks and benefits to the patient.

The efficacy and safety of 2 doses of sotalol (320 and 640 mg/day, divided in 2 doses) were compared to placebo in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 114 patients with chronic ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) at frequencies of greater than or equal to 30/hour. Sotalol significantly reduced VPCs in patients receiving both low (n = 38) and high (n = 39) doses, compared with patients (n = 37) receiving placebo (by 75 and 88%, respectively, vs 10%; p less than 0.001, sotalol vs placebo; p less than 0.05, high vs low dose). The individual efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC reduction) was achieved in 34% of low-dose and 71% of high-dose sotalol versus 6% of placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.003, sotalol vs placebo; p = 0.007, high vs low dose). Repetitive beats were suppressed 25% by placebo (difference not significant), 80% by low-dose (p less than 0.003) and 78% by high-dose sotalol (p less than 0.005). Sotalol decreased heart rate (by 24 to 25%, p less than 0.001) and increased PR (by 4 to 6%, p less than 0.001) and corrected JT intervals (by 12 to 13%, p less than 0.001), but did not change ejection fraction. Proarrhythmia (nonfatal) occurred in 3 sotalol and in 2 placebo patients. Nine discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (1 low dose and 8 high dose, p less than 0.02). In summary, sotalol is an efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for VPC suppression; in lower doses, it is somewhat less effective but better tolerated. ',\n",
       " '815': 'Endovascular management of arterial intimal defects: an experimental comparison by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasonography. To determine the feasibility of the endovascular management of intimal defects while comparing the accuracy of arteriography with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasonography, we developed an in vivo model of arterial intimal flaps. In 10 superficial femoral arteries of five anesthetized mongrel dogs, intimal flaps were constructed and then imaged by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. A flexible microbiopsy forceps was used to remove each intimal flap under angioscopic guidance. Arteriographic lumen diameters were measured and cross-sectional areas calculated. Corresponding measurements by angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound with reduction in luminal area at the flap were obtained by use of computerized planimetry. Uniplanar arteriography identified 60% (6/10) of the intimal flaps, whereas angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound demonstrated 100%. Lumen diameter (in millimeters) measured by arteriography (3.4 +/- 0.6) correlated significantly with measurements by angioscopy (3.5 +/- 0.5, r = 0.77) and intravascular ultrasound (3.5 +/- 0.6, r = 0.96). Similarly, lumen area (square millimeters) by arteriography (9.2 +/- 2.9) correlated with measurements by angioscopy (8.9 +/- 2.2, r = 0.82) and intravascular ultrasound (8.6 +/- 2.7, r = 0.91). Reduction in lumen area by the flap by angioscopy (37 +/- 7%) and intravascular ultrasound (33 +/- 8%) also correlated significantly (r = 0.72). The intimal flaps were removed successfully in all 10 arteries as confirmed by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. We conclude that the endovascular management of intimal defects is possible. Additionally, angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound accurately evaluate lumen diameter and area while providing direct assessment of intimal defects. ',\n",

The Health Care Financing Administration has contracted with state peer review organizations (PROs) in its effort to assure the quality of services and eliminate unreasonable and inappropriate care provided Medicare beneficiaries. By law, each state PRO must select 10 procedures for precertification. Coronary angioplasty has been chosen by 45 PROs for precertification and criteria in each state were developed with the advice of local physicians. This report describes the findings of a survey of these precertification criteria in an effort to determine their variability and to compare the PRO criteria to published national criteria created by expert panels. Current precertification criteria of Medicare beneficiaries show significant variability in the priorities and the clinical practice of cardiologists in performing coronary angioplasty, despite established and published guidelines for its safe and efficacious use. It is likely that the establishment of locally based criteria for coronary angioplasty will be geographically uneven and probably have a less than expected impact on the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.

Factors controlling glucose metabolism after IV load were studied in nine patients with compensated cirrhosis and in six age-matched controls. The time courses of glucose, insulin, and C peptide were analyzed by means of the minimal model technique. In cirrhosis, insulin sensitivity was reduced by approximately 70% and glucose-dependent glucose uptake (glucose effectiveness) by 45%. Decreased glucose effectiveness explained 65% of the variance of glucose disappearance and correlated with the ratio of urinary creatinine to height, an independent measure of muscle mass (r = 0.839). beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, measured on C-peptide kinetics, was variable and increased on average by 170% and 107% (first-phase and second-phase, respectively). The total amount of insulin secreted by beta-cells in the course of the study was nearly doubled, whereas the basal insulin secretion rate was in the normal range. The time courses of hepatic extraction of insulin did not differ between groups, and basal extraction was on average 58% in controls and 56% in patients with cirrhosis. It was reduced to 30% in a single patient who had severe hepatocellular failure and large spontaneous portosystemic shunting. We conclude that the alterations in glucose metabolism of cirrhosis include a decreased insulin sensitivity, a reduced glucose effectiveness, and an increased pancreatic responsiveness to glucose, leading to hyperinsulinemia. The hepatic extraction of insulin is reduced only in the very advanced stages of the disease, possibly because of a large reserve capacity of the hepatic parenchyma. ',\n",

Vasopressin and oxytocin are nonapeptides secreted from the neurohypophysis; increases in vasopressin are associated with nausea and vomiting in some, but not all, species. Our aim was to determine whether plasma vasopressin and oxytocin levels were altered in healthy volunteers who did or did not develop nausea during vection, an optokinetic stimulus which produces the illusion of self-motion. Vection was produced by rotating a drum with an inner surface of black and white vertical stripes around the seated stationary subject. Gastric myoelectrical activity was recorded continuously throughout the experiment with electrodes positioned on the abdominal surface. Plasma samples were obtained before vection and after drum rotation stopped when nausea and tachygastria were present. Vasopressin and oxytocin were extracted from plasma and quantified by RIA. During vection six subjects reported nausea and developed gastric dysrhythmias; six other subjects had no nausea and remained in normal 3-cpm myoelectrical rhythms. Vasopressin and oxytocin values before vection were similar in each group of subjects. One minute after vection stopped, plasma vasopressin levels were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in subjects experiencing nausea and tachygastrias (35.4 +/- 26.7 pmol/L) than in those without symptoms (2.7 +/- 0.47 pmol/L). Oxytocin levels were unchanged by either vection or nausea. It is concluded that 1) vasopressin, not oxytocin, neurons in the magnocellular-neurohypophyseal system are activated during vection-induced nausea and gastric dysrhythmias; and 2) illusory self-motion may be used safely to study the neuroendocrine responses to brain-gut interactions and nausea in man.

Dimensions of in vitro ultrasound images from human arteries (eight normal and nine arteriosclerotic) were compared with those from histologic sections of the vessels. In addition, in vivo ultrasound studies (23 normal and 22 arteriosclerotic) of canine femoral arteries were compared with luminal dimensions obtained from angiograms of the vessels. The correlation of in vitro ultrasound images to luminal diameters (n = 22, r = 0.96), adventitial diameters (n = 19, r = 0.83), and wall thickness (n = 19, r = 0.68) in normal human vessels was significant (p less than 0.05). In vitro measurements of images and histologic specimens from human atherosclerotic arteries also correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with luminal diameters (n = 27, r = 0.91), adventitial diameters (n = 24, r = 0.60), and wall thickness (n = 24, r = 0.62). Morphologically, in vitro images of the wall of normal human arteries had a concentric laminated appearance and atherosclerotic vessels had patchy echodense and echolucent areas. In vivo studies showed significant correlation of diameters for both normal (n = 16, r = 0.91, p less than 0.05) and arteriosclerotic (n = 16, r = 0.57, p less than 0.05) canine arteries compared with luminal dimensions measured from uniplanar angiograms.

Disrupted coronary morphologic integrity, particularly with large dissections, may be associated with an increased risk of acute coronary closure. A percutaneously placed coronary vascular stent may rapidly alleviate acute or threatened coronary closure and could reduce morbidity. Between October 1989 and June 1990, placement of a balloon-expandable, flexible metallic coil (Gianturco-Roubin) coronary stent was attempted 16 times in 15 Mayo Clinic patients--for treatment of actual or threatened abrupt coronary closure in 10 patients, for primary treatment of a lesion judged to be at high risk for dissection with conventional balloon angioplasty in 1, and for elective treatment of restenotic lesions in 5. Placement of the stent was successful in 15 attempts (94%). Associated complications, which were uncommon, were similar to those noted after balloon angioplasty. No early deaths occurred, and no patient required coronary artery bypass grafting. Stents were successfully placed in both urgent and elective circumstances in native coronary arteries and saphenous vein grafts, and they were used in primary atheromatous and restenotic lesions. Our initial experience with this metallic coil stent indicates that it is efficacious for vascular disruption that is threatening or causing coronary closure after angioplasty.

Findings at AMPR CT, conventional CT, and digital radiographic tomography were compared with findings obtained at evaluation of the resected specimen with regard to the ability to display the relationships between vessels, bronchi, and lesions. AMPR CT was significantly superior to conventional CT and digital radiographic tomography in detecting involvement of pulmonary vessels (P less than .001). Involvement of pulmonary veins was seen in all lung cancers, whereas such involvement was seen in only one of eight nonneoplastic lesions.

Correct pH probe/catheter position was continuously verified by recording transmucosal potential difference across the pylorus. Patients with active and healed duodenal ulcer had similarly disordered gastroduodenal motility. The chief abnormalities consisted of an increase in postprandial duodenal retroperistalsis (healed duodenal ulceration, 12 +/- 1 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 12 +/- 1; control, 6 +/- 1; mean +/- SEM: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively), a reduction in pressure waves sweeping aborally through the duodenum after the meal (healed duodenal ulceration, 22 +/- 4 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 23 +/- 3; control, 34 +/- 4: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.04 and P less than 0.05, respectively), and an increased incidence of atypical, complex forms of coordinated duodenal motor activity throughout the study (postprandial data; healed duodenal ulceration, 8 +/- 1 events per hour; active duodenal ulceration, 10 +/- 1; control, 4 +/- 1: healed and active duodenal ulceration vs. control, P = 0.02 and P less than 0.02, respectively). In addition, gastric emptying of the solid test meal was significantly delayed in healed, but not active, duodenal ulceration [half-emptying time, healed duodenal ulceration 185 minutes (117-235); active duodenal ulceration 102 minutes (80-200); control 107 minutes (78-130): healed duodenal ulceration vs. control, P less than 0.009]. Duodenal bulb pH was similar in controls and patients with active duodenal ulceration; however, bulb pH was less than 4 for a significantly greater period of time in healed duodenal ulceration compared with active ulcer patients, particularly after the meal. In conclusion, duodenal ulcer disease is associated with disturbed gastroduodenal motility, even when the ulcer is quiescent and when intraduodenal acidity is low. In healed duodenal ulceration, disturbed motility may promote ulcer relapse by impairing acid clearance from the bulb. However, in active ulceration other factors such as mucosal bicarbonate secretion may have a more influential role in determining intraduodenal pH. ',\n",

With the use of the C494 monoclonal antibody in an avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique, P-glycoprotein was detected in 17 of 20 tumor samples. Results were expressed in a semiquantitative manner, taking into account the number of positive tumor cells (N index) and the specific staining intensity (I index). The 17 patients with nonmetastatic cancer were followed from the first cycle of chemotherapy to cancer recurrence; subsequent to six cycles of chemotherapy, all of these patients except one were rendered clinically disease-free through surgery and/or radiation. The end point was defined as either local/regional recurrence or metastasis. Strong P-glycoprotein-positive staining in a majority of tumor cells (the N+/I+ phenotype) was significantly correlated with no initial response to chemotherapy (P less than .02) and with a shorter progression-free survival (P less than .02). Thus, the pretreatment evaluation of P-glycoprotein expression may be of prognostic value in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. ',\n",

To study leukotriene C4 release by neutrophils in patients with coronary artery disease, neutrophils were separated from blood samples taken from the coronary sinus and aorta in 20 patients with stable exertional angina and angiographically documented coronary artery narrowings (group I). Eight patients with normal coronary arteries were also studied (group II). To assess leukotriene C4 generation, neutrophils were incubated with calcium ionophore A 23187 (0.25 microM) and the supernatants obtained after centrifugation were analyzed for leukotriene C4 by radioimmunoassay. Patients in group I had a significantly lower release of leukotriene C4 from neutrophils separated from the coronary sinus blood than from those separated from aortic blood (4.33 +/- 0.69 versus 5.92 +/- 0.54 ng/ml, p less than 0.025), whereas patients in group II had a similar release of leukotriene C4 by the neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood and from aortic blood (6.0 +/- 0.72 versus 6.4 +/- 0.66 ng/ml, p = NS). Moreover, in group I patients, a significant correlation was found (p less than 0.01) between the extent of coronary artery disease (expressed by the Leaman coronary score) and the percent reduction in leukotriene C4 released from neutrophils separated from coronary sinus blood as compared with leukotriene C4 produced by neutrophils separated from aortic blood. These data show that neutrophils from patients with coronary artery disease have a reduced ability to produce leukotriene C4 after stimulation by calcium ionophore A 23187. ',\n",

To compare the effects of three different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the cough reflex, capsaicin and citric acid challenge tests were done in normal subjects and hypertensive patients before and after administration of delapril, captopril, or enalapril. Two groups of 7 normal subjects (single dose study: 15 mg delapril v 18.75 mg captopril or 2.5 mg enalapril) and a group of 6 mildly hypertensive patients (1 week study: cross-over administration of 30 mg/day delapril, 37.5 mg/day captopril, or 5 mg/day enalapril) were studied. Another group of 6 patients with essential hypertension was treated with three ACE inhibitors for 4 weeks in a randomized order, with a 2 week washout period between active therapies. Aerosols of 1 mumol/L and 3 mumol/L capsaicin and 0.68% citric acid in 0.9% NaCl were generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer, and the frequency of cough was counted during inhalation. Delapril treatment resulted in substantially fewer patients with a significant increase (greater than or equal to 4 coughs during treatment than during the control period) in the frequency of cough than did captopril treatment. In the 1 and 4 week studies, enalapril and captopril had substantially more occurrences of significantly increased capsaicin-induced cough than did delapril. These results indicate that delapril has the least cough stimulatory effect among these ACE inhibitors, which may be clinically beneficial. ',\n",

Chronic suppurative hidradenitis is a disease of the apocrine glands occurring predominantly in the axillae of the anogenital region. Treatment, to date, has been frustrating. Prolonged antibiotic therapy and multiple incisions and drainage have been the usual form of therapy, but those surgical procedures leave patients with ugly scars; retracted, hypertrophic skin edges; and pitted, indurated and disfiguring abscesses. The only successful treatment to date has been wide excision of the entire apocrine gland-bearing tissues, such as radical vulvectomy, which often necessitates grafts to cover the surgically exposed areas. That has left patients with unsatisfactorily functioning vaginas and a mutilated appearance. Recently we instituted the use of the CO2 laser to treat these patients with the goal of eradicating the suppurative sinus tracts and the infected apocrine glands without removing large volumes of adjacent, unaffected tissue. Over the past eight years we treated 11 patients who had extensive, chronic hidradenitis of the anogenital area with the CO2 laser. The use of laser therapy for these patients has produced effective and less-mutilating results. Such treatment has been a successful option for treating this debilitating disease. ',\n",

The preliminary data show that the number of superficial and deep femoral lymph nodes removed from the 42 patients (mean number of nodes, 20; range, 8-32) was similar to the number reported in anatomy books. In addition, the five-year actuarial survival rate, 70%, was comparable to that in the literature.

Seventy women residents of Athens, consecutively admitted to the major state maternity hospital with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, were individually matched with women with a newly diagnosed pregnancy of the same order as the ectopic index pregnancy. Two control women were found for each of 63 cases, but only one control for each of the remaining seven cases. All cases and controls were interviewed by the same qualified obstetrician. Statistical analysis was undertaken with stratification of individual matched triplets and pairs, as well as through conditional multiple regression procedures. The relative risk of recurrence of an ectopic pregnancy was 6.39 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-21.04. Miscarriages did not increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The relative risk for subsequent ectopic pregnancy among women with one or more induced abortion, compared to women without such abortions, was 1.87 (CI 0.84-4.16) controlling only for the matching factors, and 1.71 (CI 0.69-4.27) when marital status (a possible selection factor) was also accounted for in the conditional logistic regression. There was no evidence for increasing risk with increasing number of induced abortions.

The type of projectile, site of injury, and presence or absence of foreign material did not seem to have a significant effect on the final outcome. Of the patients with a perforating type of injury, 48.8% had a poor surgical outcome as compared with 19.9% with a penetrating type and 15.6% with a tangential type. This difference is statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.7 and 17.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). The most important factor in predicting overall outcome was the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of admission. Mortality and morbidity contributing to a poor surgical outcome were noted in only 6% of patients with a GCS score at admission of 13 to 15, in 24.6% of those with a GCS score of 9 to 12, in 57% of those with a GCS score of 6 to 8, and in 65% of those with a GCS score of 3 to 5.

The patients were five black and three white women, 56-87 years of age. The FNA specimen was cyst fluid in four cases (bloody in three, clear in one). All the aspirates showed cellular smears with small and large clusters of cells with papillary and/or cribriform configurations and numerous single epithelial cells. The cells were cuboidal to columnar with minimal atypia. ICPC was suggested by FNA in each case, and all the patients underwent surgical excision or mastectomy. Flow cytometry, performed on fresh FNA specimen in one case and on paraffin-embedded surgical tissue in all eight cases, showed seven tumors to be aneuploid and one to be diploid. The authors contend that ICPCs of breast have distinct cytomorphologic features that can be recognized by FNA. Because ICPC may present in cyst fluid, either bloody or clear, all breast cyst fluids from postmenopausal women should be examined cytologically. Flow cytometric demonstration of an aneuploid population may assist in confirming malignancy in this lesion. ',\n",
       " '845': 'Tumor angiogenesis and metastasis--correlation in invasive breast carcinoma. BACKGROUND. Experimental evidence suggests that the growth of a tumor beyond a certain size requires angiogenesis, which may also permit metastasis. To investigate how tumor angiogenesis correlates with metastases in breast carcinoma, we counted microvessels (capillaries and venules) and graded the density of microvessels within the initial invasive carcinomas of 49 patients (30 with metastases and 19 without). METHODS. Using light microscopy, we highlighted the vessels by staining their endothelial cells immunocytochemically for factor VIII. The microvessels were carefully counted (per 200x field), and their density was graded (1 to 4+), in the most active areas of neovascularization, without knowledge of the outcome in the patient, the presence or absence of metastases, or any other pertinent variable. RESULTS. Both microvessel counts and density grades correlated with metastatic disease. The mean (+/- SD) count and grade in the patients with metastases were 101 +/- 49.3 and 2.95 +/- 1.00 vessels, respectively. The corresponding values in the patients without metastases were significantly lower--45 +/- 21.1 and 1.38 +/- 0.82 (P = 0.003 and P less than or equal to 0.001, respectively). For each 10-microvessel increase in the count per 200x field, there was a 1.59-fold increase in the risk of metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.12; P = 0.003). The microvessel count and density grade also correlated with distant metastases. For each 10-microvessel increase in the vessel count per 200x field, there was a 1.17-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis (95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34; P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS. The number of microvessels per 200x field in the areas of most intensive neovascularization in an invasive breast carcinoma may be an independent predictor of metastatic disease either in axillary lymph nodes or at distant sites (or both). Assessment of tumor angiogenesis may therefore prove valuable in selecting patients with early breast carcinoma for aggressive therapy. ',\n",
       " '846': 'Hemodynamic consequences of carotid-carotid bypass for innominate artery stenosis. The carotid-carotid cervical bypass is one surgical option for symptomatic atherosclerotic lesions of the innominate artery. Controversy exists regarding the necessity of surgically excluding the innominate plaque from the cerebral circuit. A canine study was instituted to characterize the hemodynamic alterations that occur in the right common carotid artery proximal to the bypass graft, termed the critical segment. The direction of flow in the critical segment determines whether emboli originating in the innominate may be propelled cranially despite a patent bypass graft. Six mongrel dogs underwent placement of an autogenous arterial crossover graft as a carotid-carotid bypass. A stenosis of the innominate artery was quantitatively altered, and an electromagnetic flowmeter measured the magnitude and direction of flow in the critical segment at three levels of diameter reduction in the innominate artery. For low-grade stenoses, flow in the critical segment was always prograde. For high-grade stenoses, the flow was always reversed. Stenoses between 57% and 67% yielded flow values of 10 +/- 24 ml/min, and it was in this range that mean flow reversal was found to occur. Even when the mean flow was near zero in the critical segment, flow was not stagnant but oscillated in antegrade and retrograde directions throughout the cardiac cycle. These data indicate that a carotid-carotid bypass causes complete flow reversal in the critical segment when there is high-grade stenosis in the innominate artery. Theoretical analysis of the hemodynamic circuit indicated that arm exercise would augment retrograde flow in the critical segment. ',\n",

Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space. It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order. The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall. Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament. This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.

To establish the diagnostic criteria for a sinus venosus atrial septal defect cross sectional echocardiograms, cineangiograms, and surgical notes of all patients with this diagnosis seen at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. Seven patients were identified. In each the extent of the atrial septum and the nature of the junction of the superior vena cava with the atria were evaluated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. All had overriding of the superior vena cava and abnormally connected right pulmonary veins. Six patients had undergone cardiac catheterisation and cineangiography. Five patients underwent surgical repair. The operative findings were consistent with the expected morphology in all five, and these features were additionally confirmed in a specimen from the cardiopathological museum. Therefore, the basic anatomical feature of a superior sinus venosus interatrial communication is a biatrial connection of the superior vena cava. This, together with anomalous drainage of the right sided pulmonary veins, results in an interatrial communication outside the confines of the true atrial septum. Overriding of the superior vena cava across the upper rim of the oval fossa is suggested as the pathognomonic diagnostic feature that can clearly be demonstrated echocardiographically from the subcostal position. In essence the lesion is an interatrial communication rather than an atrial septal defect. \",\n",

The pathogenetic mechanism for stroke is based partly on the stenotic narrowing of the carotid artery. A diameter reduction of 75% is frequently considered hemodynamically significant and indicative of an increased risk for neurological morbidity. We studied the cerebral blood flow in 7 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who also had severe bilateral carotid disease. The results were compared with the results in 17 patients without carotid disease who had bypass grafting. The cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon 133 washout technique before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia. Acid-base regulation was according to the alpha-stat theory, and blood pressure was kept greater than 50 mm Hg. The cerebral blood flow levels (mL.100g-1.min-1) before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass in the study group (30 +/- 11, 31 +/- 8, 47 +/- 20) (mean +/- standard deviation) were almost identical to those in the control group (30 +/- 11, 28 +/- 8, 47 +/- 12). The cerebral blood flow levels for the left and right hemispheres in the group with carotid disease were comparable and within normal ranges. In 2 patients, slight differences were noted between hemispheres, and this finding may indicate an increased risk for ischemia. These patients, however, did not show any signs of postoperative deficit. The flow limitations of critical carotid stenoses do not seem to imply a risk for cerebral hypoperfusion if cardiopulmonary perfusion is performed in a controlled manner. ',\n",

We examined the potential of x-irradiation, at clinical dose levels, to manipulate the cellular constituents and thereby change the consequences of transection injury to adult mammalian central nervous tissue (rat olfactory bulb). Irradiation resulted in reduction or elimination of reactive astrocytes at the site of incision provided that it was delivered within a defined time window postinjury. Under conditions optimal for the elimination of gliosis (15-18 days postinjury), irradiation of severed olfactory bulbs averted some of the degenerative consequences of lesion. We observed that irradiation was accompanied by prevention of tissue degeneration around the site of lesion, structural healing with maintenance of the typical cell lamination, and rescue of some axotomized mitral cells (principal bulb neurons). Thus radiation resulted in partial preservation of normal tissue morphology. It is postulated that intrusive cell populations are generated in response to injury and reactive astrocytes are one such group. Our results suggest that selective elimination of these cells by irradiation enabled some of the regenerative processes that are necessary for full recovery to maintain their courses. The cellular targets of these cells, their modes of intervention in recovery, and the potential role of irradiation as a therapeutic modality for injured central nervous system are discussed. ',\n",

The predominance of vimentin and the additional expression of cytokeratin subtypes 8 and 18, as well as the negative staining for epithelial membrane antigen, accorded with results previously reported, for ovarian granulosa cell tumours; the lack of expression of desmoplakin, however, was a distinctive feature. Together with negative staining for leucocyte common antigen, the antigen pattern facilitates the differential diagnosis between granulosa cell tumour and undifferentiated carcinoma or gonadal lymphoma, although its suitability for differentiating within the group of gonadal stromal tumours seems to be limited. The small growth fraction, shown by the monoclonal antibody Ki-67, is typical of the clinical behaviour of granulosa cell tumours.

An investigation of 749 deaths occurring among 4082 patients surviving at least five years after the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Britain before 1971 has been undertaken. Of the 738 with sufficient information the numbers of deaths attributable to the following causes were: recurrent tumour, 550 (74%), a second primary tumour, 61 (8%), a medical condition related to treatment of the tumour, 49 (7%), an traumatic death unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 34 (5%), finally, any other cause unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 44 (6%). Less than 10% of five year survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour, or a soft tissue sarcoma died of recurrent tumour during the next 15 years, while more than 25% of five year survivors of Hodgkin's disease, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing's tumour died of recurrent tumour during the corresponding period. Almost 50% of five year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia died of recurrent disease during the corresponding 15 years, a large proportion of deaths being due to central nervous system relapse in an era before central nervous system prophylaxis was routinely given. Comparison of the mortality observed with that expected from mortality rates in the general population indicated three times the expected number of deaths from non-neoplastic causes. Five times the expected number of deaths from cardiovascular causes were observed, these were predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. There was no evidence of an excess in the number of suicides observed, but there were three times the expected number of deaths from accidents observed after central nervous system tumours. \",\n",

The effect of brief myocardial ischemia on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP 70) was examined in an in vivo rabbit model of myocardial ischemia using Northern blotting. Functional studies were carried out in the open-chested anesthetized rabbit. The large marginal branch of the left circumflex was occluded four times for 5 min. Using piezoelectric crystals implanted midwall in the ischemic zone, end-diastolic length, end-systolic length, and percent segmental shortening were assessed. Expression of HSP 70 was measured by Northern blotting. A single 5-min coronary occlusion doubled the expression of HSP 70 whereas four cycles of 5 min of ischemia/5 min of reperfusion resulted in a threefold increase in HSP 70 mRNA (P less than 0.001). Measurements with the piezoelectric crystals showed mild myocardial dysfunction concomitant with the increase in HSP 70. This increase in HSP 70 mRNA after repetitive brief ischemia was transient, occurring as early as 1 h and returning to baseline by 24 h after ischemia. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to HSP 70 was used to compare sham and postischemic myocardial HSP 70 levels. Changes in the amount of HSP 70 were evident as early as 2 h and were even more striking at 24 h. ',\n",

HPV DNA was found in 73 of 172 (42%) anogenital lesions and 17 of 116 (15%) nonanogenital carcinomas. No HPV DNA was found in normal mouse skin (five samples), human autopsy liver (two samples), or kidney (eight samples), or in carcinomas of the breast (three samples), bladder (five samples), or colon (nine samples). Of the nongenital tumors, HPV DNA was found in the carcinomas of the lung (2 of 5), anus (7 of 18), esophagus (9 of 39), buccal cavity (1 of 5), and larynx (5 of 50). HPV DNA was also detected in 2 of 11 histologically normal specimens of the cervix and 1 of 3 human skin lesions. The detection of HPV DNA in carcinomas of the lung, larynx, and esophagus as well as in the anogenital region confirms recent suggestions that HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 have a wider association with different types of cancer than previously believed.

Two hundred eighty-seven patients undergoing minor elective procedures under general anesthesia were studied. Four to six hours after anesthesia each patient completed a questionnaire assessing his or her own alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine consumption, and the occurrence of postoperative side effects. A highly significant difference was found between the caffeine consumption of patients with and without preoperative (P = 0.0035) and postoperative (P less than 0.0001) headache. Logistic regression analysis of trend between headache and caffeine consumption suggested that with each 100-mg increase in caffeine consumption, there was a 12% increase in the odds of headache developing in the immediate preoperative period (P less than 0.0066) and a 16% increase in the odds of postoperative headache developing (P less than 0.0001). No relationship was found between headache and the patients' age, sex, usual frequency of headache, consumption of alcohol or nicotine, or the anesthetic agents or adjuvants used. It is concluded that postoperative headache is related to caffeine intake and that this relationship is explained, at least in part, by a perioperative caffeine withdrawal syndrome. \",\n",

Forty-seven patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma were treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-cell therapy, using a hybrid IL-2 regimen. IL-2 was administered initially by intravenous bolus (10(5) U/kg [Cetus Corp, Emeryville, CA] every 8 hours for 3 days) during the priming phase, and subsequently by continuous infusion (3 x 10(6) U/m2 for 6 days); during this second treatment period, in vitro-generated LAK cells were administered. Despite selection of patients for good performance status (PS) (29, PS 0; 18, PS 1) prior nephrectomy (43 of the 47 patients), and low tumor burden, the response rate was low (two complete [CRs] and two partial responses [PRs], for an overall objective response rate of 9%).

In most cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia, the ipsilateral lung was underdeveloped morphologically and biochemically compared with the contralateral lung. However, both ipsilateral and contralateral lungs were well developed in some cases of unilateral diaphragmatic hernia. Thus, acinar development of hypoplastic lung in diaphragmatic hernia is varied.

Acute autonomic neuropathy can be primarily cholinergic without orthostatic hypotension (26%) or pandysautonomic (74%) involving sympathetic adrenergic functions. Onset has been temporally related to viral syndromes in 20% of cases, with autonomic deficits usually evolving over 1 to 3 weeks. Gastroparesis (69%) and syncope (12%) are frequent presenting complaints. Spinal fluid protein levels are often (75%) elevated in pandysautonomic subtypes. Prolonged and incomplete recovery is the rule (60%), with persistent gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension. Other specific diseases that occasionally mimic acute autonomic neuropathy include botulism, porphyria, amyloidosis, and paracarcinomatous neuropathies. Acute autonomic neuropathy shares several clinical features with acute idiopathic polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome), suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis. ',\n",

In three groups of six dogs each (N = 18), normothermic ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (no blood flow) of 17 minutes was reversed by cardiopulmonary bypass--normothermic in control group I (37.5 degrees C) and hypothermic to 3 hours in groups II (32 degrees C) and III (28 degrees C). Defibrillation was achieved in less than or equal to 5 minutes and partial bypass was continued to 4 hours, controlled ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. All 18 dogs survived. Electroencephalographic activity returned significantly earlier in groups II and III. Mean +/- SD best neurologic deficit between 48 and 96 hours was 44 +/- 8% in group I, 38 +/- 12% in group II, and 35 +/- 7% in group III (differences not significant). Best overall performance category 2 (good outcome) between 48 and 96 hours was achieved in none of the six dogs in group I and in four of the 12 dogs in the combined hypothermic groups II and III (difference not significant).

       " '876': \"Effect of stress on diagnosis of hypertension. Blood pressure assessment by a physician elicits an alerting reaction and a pressor response in the patient. The magnitude and time course of this response are described for a large number of hypertensive subjects in whom the assessments were performed during ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. In nearly all of the subjects, the physician's visit was accompanied by blood pressure and heart rate increases that peaked within 4 minutes and then declined. The response was characterized by a relatively high average value; a large between-subject variability; no relation with patient age, baseline hemodynamic values, and responses to laboratory stressors; and no attenuation with multiple repetition of the physician's visit. On the other hand, the increase in blood pressure was considerably less when blood pressure assessment was made by a nurse than when it was made by a physician; in both instances, a 10-minute wait was associated with marked reduction of the initial response. Thus, the stress inherent in usual blood pressure-measuring procedures is responsible for considerable overestimations of patients' blood pressures. There are means by which this can be minimized, although a residual error is likely to remain in most subjects. Whether the stress-devoid blood pressure is a better prognostic index than the stress-related one remains unknown. \",\n",

We also surveyed all anaesthetists in three major hospitals to ascertain their techniques for this method of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced in all patients with thiopentone and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. The first group received 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide as carrier gases, a second group a few normal breaths of 100% oxygen during thiopentone administration followed by 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide, while a third group received 100% oxygen after loss of eyelash reflex until spontaneous breathing was established. No patient received positive pressure ventilation before spontaneous breathing was established. Six of the 10 patients in the first group became hypoxaemic compared to none in the second group, and three patients became hypoxaemic in the third group. Thirty-seven percent of anaesthetists who responded to the survey either did not apply positive pressure ventilation before establishment of spontaneous breathing, or only did so if apnoea was prolonged.

Of the six patients in the series, two had a pituitary adenoma and one each had a metastatic melanoma, multiple myeloma, craniopharyngioma, and lymphoepithelioma. Visual acuity in the affected eyes ranged from 20/25 to no light perception. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed sellar and parasellar recurrence of both pituitary adenomas, but the intrinsic lesions of the optic nerves and optic chiasm induced by radiation were enhanced after gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) administration and were clearly distinguishable from the suprasellar compression of tumor. Repeated MR imaging showed spontaneous resolution of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement of the optic nerve in a patient who was initially suspected of harboring recurrence of a metastatic malignant melanoma as the cause of visual loss. The authors found the presumptive diagnosis of radiation-induced optic neuropathy facilitated by MR imaging with gadolinium-DTPA.

The natural history of CAD in insulin-dependent (ID) and noninsulin-dependent (NID) diabetes mellitus (DM) is reviewed to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of premature or accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. In both IDDM and NIDDM, the risk of CAD increases with lengthening duration of diabetes; the risk, however, does not grow as a constant multiple of the nondiabetic risk of CAD, suggesting that the cumulative exposure to diabetes plays a significant role as a risk factor for CAD only in a subset of patients. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the diabetic milieu has an impact on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions but not on their initiation. This hypothesis is corroborated further by the observation that CAD does not occur in diabetic patients in populations with a low risk of CAD among nondiabetic patients. The component of the diabetic milieu responsible for promotion of atherosclerotic lesions is unknown. There is evidence, however, of a direct or indirect role of hyperinsulinemia in this process.

Operative and perioperative parameters, donor-site morbidity, and long-term results were evaluated, compared, and analyzed. There were no significant differences between the two groups, and equally good results in terms of bone incorporation, tooth eruption, and appearance were obtained with both iliac and cranial bone grafts. We conclude from our study that successful bone grafting is primarily achieved by adherence to meticulous surgical technique, simultaneous closure of coexisting oronasal or palatal fistulae, use of cancellous bone particles only, and coverage of the grafts with well-vascularized flaps. The source of bone graft does not seem to primarily influence the success of the outcome. ',\n",

       " '893': 'Chronic calcium channel blockade prevents the progression of myocardial contractile and electrical dysfunction in the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster. The programmed onset of myocardial dysfunction and its progression to congestive heart failure in the cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster is hallmarked by alterations in myocellular calcium regulation. To determine whether calcium channel blockade is effective in halting the progressive depression of myocardial contractile performance in this animal model of congestive heart failure, oral verapamil therapy was instituted at 50 days of age, and treatment continued for various durations until the time of study at either 150 or 250 days of age. Left ventricular papillary muscle isometric and isotonic performance, as well as transmembrane electrical characteristics, was depressed in diseased hamsters at 150 days of age and deteriorated further by 250 days of age. These changes were evidenced by prolongation of contraction duration, a marked depression in the load-velocity relation, and a significant prolongation in the repolarization phase of the transmembrane action potential. Myocardial functional and electrical alterations associated with the progression of life in myopathic hamsters were completely halted by verapamil therapy that was continuous from 50 days after birth until death by diastolic arrest, at 150 or 250 days of age. However, premature termination of verapamil treatment before death resulted in a progressive renewal of the functional and electrical alterations for the duration of drug termination. It is concluded that the pathological changes seen during the lifetime of the cardiomyopathic hamster can be prevented by continuous calcium channel blockade and that intermediate prevention can be attained by protracted verapamil therapy. Thus, chronic verapamil therapy may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of human congestive heart failure of similar etiology. ',\n",

The highest incidence of remote neuromuscular disorders in cancer has previously been reported in lung carcinoma. The clinical incidence of neuromuscular disorder was estimated and correlated with muscle histology and the histological type of lung tumour in 100 patients with lung carcinoma who were studied prospectively. Thirty-five patients had small cell carcinoma and 65 patients non-small cell lung cancer. Clinically, 33 patients had a polymyopathy, of whom 18 had a cachectic myopathy and 15 had a proximal myopathy (two patients had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one presented with dermatomyositis and one had evidence of ectopic ACTH production). Cachexia was more common in non-small cell cancer; proximal myopathy was more common in small cell cancer. Ninety-nine patients had abnormal muscle histology; 74 had type II atrophy, 12 had type I and II atrophy, one had type I atrophy and 12 had necrosis. The majority of patients were affected sub-clinically and the clinical entities of cachectic and proximal myopathy did not correspond to previous pathological classifications. Atrophy was not related to the duration of tumour symptoms, ageing, clinical type of myopathy or histological type of lung tumour, and was statistically different from that seen in controls. Qualitatively, the presence of weight loss, muscle wasting and metastatic disease were not factors in the development of atrophy. Similarly, necrosis was not related to the type of lung tumour, the presence of metastases, ageing, weight loss, muscle wasting, duration of tumour symptoms or the clinical form of myopathy. This study demonstrates that lung carcinoma has a direct effect on the motor unit, including atrophy, a necrobiotic myopathy and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Clinical assessment does not accurately assess the 'remote' neuromuscular effects of cancer on the motor unit. \",\n",
       " '895': 'The Merkel cell and associated neoplasms in the eyelids and periocular region. Merkel cells are clear oval cells in the epidermis and outer root sheaths of hair follicles, which are probably of epithelial origin, share ultrastructural features with neuroendocrine cells, and are found in association with touch receptors. In the eyelid, they occur singly in the epidermis and external root sheaths of hairs and eyelashes, and in specialized touch spots alternating with eyelashes. Their typical electron microscopical and antigenic features include dense-core granules, intranuclear rodlets, spinous processes, and a positive reaction for specific cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and synaptophysin. Merkel cell carcinoma probably develops from precursor cells which give rise to keratinocytes and Merkel cells, and nearly one out of ten Merkel cell carcinomas occur in the eyelid and periocular region. They tend to be bulging lesions near the lid margin of elderly patients, reddish in color, and erythematous with telangiectatic vessels. The diagnosis is based on the frequent presence of neurofilaments and paranuclear aggregates of intermediate filaments in addition to features typical of normal Merkel cells. The tumor often mimics lymphoma or undifferentiated carcinoma and frequently invades lymphatic vessels. One third of Merkel cell carcinomas recur, almost two thirds give rise to regional node metastases, and up to one half metastasize widely and result in death. Initial treatment should be prompt and aggressive, with wide resection and routine postoperative irradiation. Although metastatic lesions often respond to radiation therapy and cytostatic drugs, these treatments are mainly of palliative value. ',\n",

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Pulse oximetry was used to measure arterial oxygen saturation and the extent of hypoxemia in pediatric patients undergoing FB. DESIGN: Arterial oxygen saturation was measured (1) prior to the procedure to provide a baseline value, (2) when the bronchoscope was positioned in the nasopharynx, and (3) when the bronchoscope was positioned in the mid-trachea. SETTING: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in the Pediatric Special Care Unit or in the Pediatric Pulmonary Laboratory using an Olympus BF3C4 fiberoptic bronchoscope with a 3.5-mm outer diameter. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six children who underwent diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy for a variety of reasons were evaluated. They ranged in age from 6 to 142 months; 20 were male and 16 were female. INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the 36 patients, 29 experienced a fall in SaO2 levels exceeding 5 percent of baseline values. The youngest age group, 6 to 12 months, showed the greatest drop in saturation as compared with the other groups. Desaturation was significantly increased by midtracheal FB. CONCLUSIONS: A decline in arterial oxygen saturation that may be substantial in infants and children undergoing FB examination was frequently noted, especially in smaller infants and when the bronchoscope was positioned in the mid-trachea. Supplemental oxygen and a brisk procedure time will minimize the risk of dangerous hypoxia. ',\n",

The baseline electrocardiograms of 5,125 original subjects of the Framingham Heart Study were measured to examine the relation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) to risk of total mortality, sudden cardiac death, and death due to coronary artery disease over a 30-year follow-up period. Quintiles of QTc (seconds) less than or equal to 0.36, 0.36 to 0.38, 0.39 to 0.40, 0.41 to 0.43 and greater than or equal to 0.44 were studied in relation to these outcomes. There were no significant differences in the risk of total mortality, sudden cardiac death or death due to coronary artery disease according to QTc. A similar lack of significant association between QTc and these 3 outcomes was observed among all persons studied and in the 2 sexes after using a multiple regression analysis to control for several potentially confounding characteristics including age, gender, cigarette smoking, serum total cholesterol, systolic systemic blood pressure and Framingham relative weight. The results of this study fail to demonstrate an association between baseline QTc and overall mortality, and deaths due to sudden cardiac events or coronary artery disease in a large population-based cohort of essentially healthy persons in whom pathologic forms of QTc prolongation are uncommon.

Serum samples from 20 Indian children with diarrhoea were compared with those from 20 children resident in the United Kingdom who had been diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease, or indeterminate colitis using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays specific for Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. More than 50% of the United Kingdom patients had high IgG responses in ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia. A confirmatory ELISA showed that the British sera reacted specifically to bovine serum proteins rather than to protozoal antigens. Prior incubation of sera with 5% bovine serum prohibited this reaction. Bovine serum is an integral part of the crude soluble antigen used in most ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia and needs to be replaced with purified antigen preparations. The British sera also reacted to other commonly used blocking agents such as bovine serum albumin, casein, and normal sheep serum. These reactions were attributed to uptake of dietary antigens or an enhanced immunological response to these antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. \",\n",

There is no consensus about the most appropriate management of the patient with intermittent claudication due to a superficial femoral artery occlusion. To evaluate the natural history of prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal (AKFP) bypass, 200 operations for intermittent claudication were reviewed. One hundred AKFP bypasses were done with PTFE and 100 with dacron. In the 30 day postoperative period, four PTFE and three dacron grafts occluded without consequence and only one patient died. Analysis of results by the life-table method demonstrated statistically similar primary graft patency rates at five years (PTFE 65% SE +/- 6.5, dacron 57% +/- 6.2) and ten years (PTFE 31% +/- 18/9, dacron 32% +/- 13.2) (p greater than 0.10). Redo procedures (e.g., thrombectomy, angioplasty) were necessary on 21 grafts (12 PTFE, 9 dacron) and \"secondary\" patency rates at five years were 76% PTFE and 62% dacron; no grafts which required a redo procedure were patent at ten year follow-up. Major amputations during ten year follow-up were necessary in 16 (8%) patients; all amputations were in diabetic patients. Survival rates were 79% at five and 42% at ten years. An anticipated, the leading cause of death was cardiac related (25 patients); 28 (14%) patients underwent aortocoronary bypass during follow-up. A prosthetic AKFP bypass graft is a safe and durable operation which provides relief from the symptoms of intermittent claudication while allowing for the preservation of the saphenous vein for use later in the coronary or infrapopliteal circulations, should the need arise. These results indicate that the risk of amputation after AKFP is no greater than the natural history of untreated claudication; however, AKFP offers a significant improvement in life-style. ',\n",

Intraglandular activation of pancreatic enzymes occurs (by an unclear mechanism), and their entry into the circulation causes most of the local and systemic events of pancreatitis. The diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, an elevation of serum amylase above 1000 IU/L, and ultrasound and CT scans. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can be used in less certain cases to confirm the presence of common bile duct stones. Because of the absence of an agent that can abort progression of the disease, therapy should consist of adequate resuscitation, nutritional support, and careful monitoring to detect early complications. In patients with mild pancreatitis, surgery usually can be performed within 48 or 72 hours of admission or as soon as symptoms and amylase levels return to normal. For patients with severe disease, endoscopic sphincterotomy is emerging as the therapeutic modality of choice. Elective treatment of the associated biliary disease should be performed during the same hospitalization after the acute phase of the disease has subsided. ',\n",

Impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling at rest is frequently observed in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who have normal LV systolic function and no previous infarction. To test the hypothesis that abnormal diastolic function at rest might reflect the functional severity of CAD, as estimated by exercise-induced ischemia, the relation between regional and global LV diastolic function at rest and during exercise-induced ischemia was evaluated in 49 patients with radionuclide angiography. All patients had normal systolic function at rest. Group 1 (n = 26) patients manifested a normal ejection fraction response to exercise and group 2 (n = 23) patients an abnormal response. Data obtained from 22 age-comparable normal volunteers were used for comparison. Although regional and global diastolic function were not different between normal subjects and group 1 patients, peak filling rate was lower in group 2 patients than in normal subjects (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic counts/s; p less than 0.01). Moreover, regional diastolic asynchrony, as assessed from the radionuclide data by using a regional sector analysis of the LV region of interest, was greater in group 2 patients (46 +/- 44 ms) than in both normal subjects (25 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05) and group 1 patients (23 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05). Thus, among patients with CAD and with normal LV systolic function at rest, impaired LV filling and regional asynchrony predict a greater degree of exercise-induced ischemia, suggesting a greater extent of jeopardized myocardium.

Our results indicate that: 1) HBV-infected subjects who develop a self-limited acute hepatitis show a vigorous PBMC response to hepatitis B core Ag and HBeAg, as expression of T cell activation; 2) appearance of a detectable lymphocyte response to HBV nucleocapsid Ag is temporally associated with the clearance of HBV envelope Ag; 3) in patients with chronic HBV infection the level of T cell responsiveness to hepatitis B core Ag and to HBeAg is significantly lower than that observed during acute infection; 4) T cell sensitization to HBV envelope Ag in acute and chronic HBV infection is usually undetectable and when measurable is expressed transiently and at low levels.

New, fully automated techniques of statistical analysis of the complete set of esophageal pressure and pH signals were used to examine the temporal relation between pain, esophageal motility disturbances, and gastroesophageal reflux. The analysis used the 97.5th percentile of amplitude and duration of all esophageal contractions in each patient as well as a chi 2 test of the distribution of contraction types to determine whether a pain episode was related to abnormal motility or not. The edrophonium test results were positive in 2 patients. Only 25 patients (56.8%) had at least one pain episode (total, 111 episodes) during 24-hour recording.

We analyzed the effect of Aspirin on the growth of experimentally induced vascular thickenings in rat carotid arteries. Vascular thickenings were induced by denudation of the endothelium in the left carotid artery with a balloon catheter. Administration of Aspirin-rich food (17.4 g/kg body wt/day) was started 1 week before and continued 2 weeks after injury. Nine rats were used. A control group of equal size received normal food. Sizes of the tunica media, the neointima, and the open vessel lumen were measured on cross sections of carotid segments with the aid of a videomorphometry system. The results show that in the Aspirin group, neointimal lesions are significantly smaller than in the control group (0.14 mm2 versus 0.23 mm2; p less than 0.5). Thickenings of the tunica media are also reduced (0.11 mm2 versus 0.12 mm2; p less than 0.5). It is suggested that Aspirin reduces both medial hypertrophy and neointimal outgrowth in injury-induced atherosclerosis. ',\n",

We tested whether vitreoperfusion, a new method of perfusing the vitreous cavity with solutions containing nutrients, can limit retinal injury if initiated after the onset of ischemia. Severe bilateral ocular ischemia was induced in cats with healed lensectomy-vitrectomy wounds; 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes later, one eye from each of 18 cats underwent vitreoperfusion while the ischemia continued for 120 minutes. The other eye simultaneously underwent either continued untreated ischemia or reinstated circulation. The histopathologic abnormalities evident after 8 days depended on the duration of ischemia. Reinstated circulation yielded less retinal damage than continued ischemia. Nine additional cats underwent bilateral ischemia for at least 210 minutes. Vitreoperfusion was initiated in one eye after 30 minutes. In each cat, the vitreoperfused eye fared significantly better as observed histopathologically and electroretinographically. We believe that no other treatment has similarly limited retinal injury in vivo when initiated so long after total ocular ischemia has developed. ',\n",

One of the most severe complications of laparoscopic tubal sterilization is bowel burns, although they often go undetected at the time of laparoscopy. Controversy remains over whether these injuries are caused directly by operator error or indirectly from a hot oviduct's or instrument's inadvertently touching and burning the intestine. A study was performed to determine the potential for direct or indirect bowel burns using bipolar electrocoagulation in rabbits. The results indicate that neither a hot tube nor hot (recently used) forceps could cause injuries to the serosal surface of the intestine. That was true both of immediate injury and after one to five days of recovery. It was observed that the hot uterine tube caused significant bowel adhesions by five days after the procedure. Direct electrocoagulation of the bowel using 40 W for three seconds caused a minor, noticeable blanch on the bowel that was not detectable with gross or histologic means after one day of recovery. A direct bowel injury did result when 80 W was used for three seconds; the bowel became perforated after one day. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that one can produce a bowel burn indirectly from a hot uterine tube or instrument and that only a direct insult to the bowel appears to cause an injury. However, adhesions could be a complication of the procedure and should be considered. \",\n",

Establishing a diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease can be difficult because Kayser-Fleischer rings may not be present and parameters of copper metabolism, including serum and urinary copper, and serum ceruloplasmin levels are neither specific nor diagnostic. In this study, ratios of both the serum alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase were constructed to evaluate their usefulness in differentiating fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease (n = 6) from other etiologies (n = 43). An analysis of the data showed that cutoff values of less than 2.0 for the alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio and greater than 4.0 for the aspartate transaminase ratio were associated with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease only (P less than 0.001).

To investigate the influence of orifice geometry on the three-dimensional shape of jets, an in vitro Doppler color flow study was performed. Jets were formed by discharging blood through round orifices and through orifices with major/minor axis ratios of 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1. These were repeated with orifice areas of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 cm2. For turbulent and laminar jets formed by these orifices, Doppler color flow images were obtained from two orthogonal scanning planes aligned with the major and minor orifice axes. Jet width was measured at 1 cm intervals from 0 to 5 cm from the orifice and used to calculate jet eccentricity (ratio of major to minor axis widths) and the rate of divergence of the jet walls. Jets were observed to diverge more rapidly along walls aligned with the orifice minor axis rather than along the major axis. This differential spreading led to the development of circular symmetry at a short distance from the orifice. Jet divergence (theta) occurred more rapidly for turbulent jets and for jets formed by larger orifices: theta (zero) = 0.80 + 6.3.A + 7.0.T + 0.47.E-OR (r = 95, p less than 0.0001, n = 48), where A is orifice area (cm2); T is 0 for laminar jets, 1 for turbulent jets and E-OR combines orifice eccentricity and scanning orientation, ranging from -5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the major axis, 0 for circular orifices to 5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the minor axis. Within the jet, eccentricity decayed approximately exponentially with distance from the orifice, more rapidly for turbulent jets, more slowly for the larger and more eccentric orifices. ',\n",

A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome similar to those described in Drosophila melanogaster occurs in Drosophila virilis when a laboratory stock is crossed to a wild strain collected in the Batumi region of Georgia (U.S.S.R). Mutations in various loci obtained during these crosses are presumably induced by the insertion of DNA sequences. We have cloned an induced white mutation and characterized the insertion sequence responsible for the mutant phenotype. This sequence is a 10.6-kilobase (kb) transposable element we have named Ulysses. This element is flanked by unusually large 2.1-kb long terminal repeats. Ulysses also contains other landmarks characteristic of the retrotransposon family, such as a tRNA-binding site adjacent to the 5' long terminal repeat and open reading frames encoding putative products with homology to the reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase domains typical of proteins encoded by vertebrate retroviruses. Some of the mutations obtained do not contain a copy of the Ulysses element at the mutant locus, suggesting that a different transposable element may be responsible for the mutation. Therefore, Ulysses may not be the primary cause of the entire dysgenic syndrome, and its mobilization may be the result of activation by an independent mobile element. \",\n",

To evaluate usefulness and limitations of proximal jet dimensions for the quantitation of valvular regurgitation, fluid jets were created in a pulsatile flow model, and proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were measured by means of color Doppler flow imaging. When circular orifices with diameters from 1 to 6 mm were studied, jet width and cross-sectional jet area measured as close as possible to the orifice were directly related to the orifice diameter (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 0.4 mm; y = 0.5 + 0.97x) and the orifice area (r = 0.97; standard error of the estimate, 5.7 mm2; y = 0.22 + 2.47x), respectively. No significant dependence on flow rate or pressure gradient was found for these measurements. Jet width was measured with color M-mode Doppler by use of the smallest sample volume size (1 mm) and was slightly greater than the orifice diameter (4.2 +/- 1.7 mm versus 3.8 +/- 1.7 mm). However, cross-sectional areas were approximately fourfold the orifice areas, on average (52.5 +/- 24.6 mm2 versus 12.3 +/- 9.7 mm2), with a range of twelvefold (smallest orifice) to threefold (largest orifice). When the sample volume size was reduced from 2.4 to 1.0 mm, color areas decreased by 25.6 +/- 6.0%. Slit-shaped orifices were studied with two different orientations of the slit-parallel and perpendicular to the ultrasound beam: Color M-mode measurements were again slightly greater than length and width of the slit, but cross-sectional areas were substantially larger than the orifice areas and increased between 44% and 115% when changing the orientation of the slit from perpendicular to parallel. This, again, reflected problems with lateral resolution. When cross-sectional areas were measured at increasing distances from the orifice, the cross-sectional jet area increased significantly within a few millimeters. This increase was greater with higher gradients and smaller orifice sizes. In case of a small orifice (2 mm) and a high gradient (130 to 160 mm Hg), increase in area was as great as 122% within a distance of only 5 mm. Thus, proximal jet width and cross-sectional area were directly related to the orifice size, which could be a valuable parameter for the evaluation of valvular regurgitation. Measurements of jet width by color M-mode seemed to be most accurate but are limited by the fact that in vivo valvular defects may be irregular rather than of circular shape.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

Interferons and interferon induction can inhibit cytochromes P-450 and reduce the bioactivation and hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen. However, since P-450 inhibition often is followed by P-450 induction, which would enhance acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, the possibility of a biphasic modulation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by interferons was investigated. Outbred male CD-1 mice of various ages, and young inbred male C57BL/6 mice were given the interferon inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I-C), 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, followed 1 to 48 days later by a single dose of acetaminophen, 300 to 450 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by the peak plasma concentration of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurring between 0 and 48 hr after acetaminophen treatment. Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen given within 8 days, with maximal inhibition between 1 and 4 days. Conversely, a maximal 7-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed in CD-1 mice when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 32 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). In the C57BL/6 strain, Poly I-C inhibited the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen when given within 16 days, whereas a maximal 20-fold enhancement of ALT concentration was observed when 300 mg/kg of acetaminophen was given 24 days after Poly I-C (P less than 0.05). The mechanism of toxicologic enhancement was examined in male C57BL/6 mice using the same treatment regimen. Biochemical assessment of hepatotoxicity was confirmed by detailed histologic evaluation. Plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Acetaminophen bioactivation was quantified by production of the glutathione-derived cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates of acetaminophen. Poly I-C pretreatment produced a 5-fold increase in acetaminophen-induced ALT release (P less than 0.05), which correlated with histologic evidence of centrilobular necrosis. Poly I-C pretreatment produced respective 3-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the production of cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates (P less than 0.05), which correlated with peak ALT concentrations (cysteine, r = 0.92, P less than 0.001; mercapturic acid, r = 0.75, P = 0.006). Thus, the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen can be inhibited when given within days after interferon induction, and conversely enhanced when given after several weeks. The toxicologic enhancement appears to be due to increased P-450-catalyzed bioactivation of acetaminophen. ',\n",

All were assessed prospectively to be at risk neurodevelopmental delay. This first report specifically addresses the appearance of primarily hemorrhagic intracranial lesions, including intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 28), and extracerebral lesions, which include 3 cases of venous sinus thrombosis (n = 20). The signal intensities of hemorrhage underwent a characteristic evolution with time with only minor variations in the study group. Magnetic resonance imaging detected direct evidence of hemorrhage for up to 2 months, but hemosiderin was detected as a late indicator of hemorrhage for up to 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging was equal in benefit to head ultrasonography and computed tomography for the diagnosis of intraventricular hemorrhage, but magnetic resonance imaging was also able to approximate the time of onset of hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior for the evaluation of extracerebral hemorrhage; ultrasonography failed to detect any of these lesions and computed tomography detected only 3 of 7. Short-term neurological abnormality was assessed, but the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to predict long-term neurodevelopmental delay is unknown and is the subject of an ongoing project.

The four transvenous defibrillation techniques were 1) single pathway monophasic pulsing, 2) single pathway biphasic pulsing, 3) dual pathway sequential pulsing, and 4) dual pathway simultaneous pulsing. A transvenous defibrillation method was considered to be potentially useful only if the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 500 V (less than or equal to 15 J delivered energy). The 500 V value would allow a 2:1 defibrillation safety margin for a device with a maximal output of 30 J. No single transvenous pulsing technique was uniformly superior in efficacy. However, by choosing the best pulsing technique for each patient, it was possible to obtain an average defibrillation threshold of 410 +/- 135 V leading edge voltage, 7.2 +/- 2.5 A leading edge current and 11.3 +/- 7.4 J delivered energy for the group of 12 patients. With the ability to vary defibrillation technique, transvenous antiarrhythmic device implantation would have been possible in 10 (83%) of the 12 patients at or below a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be safely performed by experienced surgeons in patients with acute cholecystitis. To ensure a low complication rate, a low threshold for converting the procedure to an open laparotomy must be maintained if the ductal and vascular anatomy cannot be safely demonstrated. ',\n",

This article explores the hypothesis that migraine with aura is associated with a state of central neuronal hyperexcitability. The authors propose that this central neuronal hyperexcitability involves overactivity of the excitatory amino acids, glutamate, and possibly aspartate. Stimuli that activate the migraine attack evoke neuronal depolarization, slow depolarization shifts, and spreading suppression of spontaneous neuronal activity possible by glutamate and K+ dependent mechanisms. A low brain Mg2+ and consequent reduced gating of glutamatergic receptors may provide the link between the physiologic threshold for a migraine attack and the mechanisms of the attack itself by promoting glutamate hyperactivity, neuronal hyperexcitability, and susceptibility to glutamate-dependent spreading depression.

This study evaluated the effect of bilateral carotid chemodenervation on the cerebrovascular response to hypoxia in conscious rats. Cerebral blood flow was measured using 4-iodo[N-methyl-14C]antipyrine, and the total and perfused microvasculature was studied by injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran and alkaline phosphatase staining. To maintain constant PCO2, hypoxia was achieved in chemoreceptor-intact rats by the use of 4% CO2-8% O2-88% N2 and in chemodenervated rats by the administration of 8% O2-92% N2. Blood gas and hemodynamic parameters were similar in the two groups of rats. Chemodenervation had no significant effect on either resting blood flow or the perfused microvasculature during normoxia. A significant increase in cerebral blood flow (from 71 +/- 3 to 138 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g in control and from 91 +/- 5 to 127 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g in chemodenervated rats) and in the percent of cerebral arterioles and capillaries perfused occurred in both hypoxic control and chemodenervated rats. In chemoreceptor-intact rats, the greatest increase in blood flow and in perfused microvasculature occurred in caudal structures (medulla and pons) in comparison with rostral structures (cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus). In chemodenervated rats, a similar increase in blood flow and perfused microvasculature occurred in all brain regions, with no regional differences. Thus, chemodenervation did not affect the overall cerebral blood flow or the microvascular response to hypoxia; however, rostral-to-caudal regional differences in the hypoxic response were lost after chemodenervation.

We investigated the effects of energy restriction on the pituitary-ovarian axis and on a hormone responsive gene, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Female C3H/SHN F1-hybrid mice, known to display a high incidence of mammary tumors, ate an energy-restricted diet (48 kcal/wk) or a control diet (95 kcal/wk) beginning at the time of weaning. By 67 wk of age, 12 of 32 mice in the control group, but none of the 33 mice in the energy-restricted group, had developed mammary tumors. Six tumor-free mice from each group were studied in detail at 67 wk of age. All six tumor-free control mice, but none of the six energy-restricted mice, showed uterine endometrial hyperplasia at autopsy. Mice subjected to energy restriction did not display an estrous cycle. The average levels of MMTV mRNA in mammary glands and uteri were strongly reduced by energy restriction. MMTV mRNA levels in mammary glands from control mice were two orders of magnitude lower than those in mammary tumors. Energy restriction lowered the percentage of pituitary mammatropes and suppressed proliferation of mammatropes with advancing age. Energy restriction thus appeared to inhibit endometrial hyperplasia and to decrease MMTV production at the mRNA level in the mammary glands and in the uterus. These effects may be a consequence of hormonal changes originating at the pituitary-ovarian axis. ',\n",

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach to the treatment of cancer. Preferential retention of the photosensitizer by malignant tissue has been considered a hallmark of this treatment modality. However, photosensitivity can be observed in normal, non-neoplastic tissues, and the present study investigated the effects of PDT treatment on the abdomen of intact rats. A circular region (1 cm diameter) on the shaved abdomen of Fischer rats, pretreated 24 h prior with Photofrin II, was irradiated for 30 min at 632 nm. Control animals received either photoradiation or Photofrin II administration. Subsequent lesions were observed in the irradiated skin, its associated abdominal wall, and the underlying gut in rats receiving Photofrin II and laser irradiation. All tissues were not equally sensitive to PDT treatment. Gut lesions were consistently more severe than were skin and abdominal wall injuries. By 24 hr after treatment, the gut manifested a transmural hemorrhagic necrosis, while the irradiated skin and abdominal wall were edematous, with an inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis and around occasional swollen myocytes. These results indicate that superficial lesions induced by PDT may not be reliable indicators of the extent of deeper PDT tissue damage. Further, it may be possible to take advantage of this discrepancy in tissue sensitivity and treat deep tissues through less sensitive superficial tissues. ',\n",

This study was performed to determine the power of frequency analysis to detect patients with a history of ventricular fibrillation, to determine the extent to which spectra of signal-averaged ECGs from patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease are comparable and to compare results of signal-averaged ECG analysis in patients with ventricular fibrillation with results of programmed ventricular stimulation. Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with ventricular fibrillation (Group II). Results of signal-averaged ECG analysis were abnormal in 92% of patients with ventricular tachycardia and 85% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS). Abnormal spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90% of patients with ischemic and from 86% of patients with nonischemic heart disease (p = NS). In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly between the two patient groups. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 91% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared with only 46% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.0001). Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81% of patients with ischemic heart disease compared with only 50% of those with nonischemic heart disease (p less than 0.02). Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with ventricular fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose arrhythmia was not inducible by programmed stimulation. These results broaden the potential clinical application of noninvasive interrogation of signal-averaged ECGs to include the prospective identification of patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

Whether parenchymal or nonparenchymal liver cells play a predominant role in the pathophysiology of hepatic fibrosis has not been firmly established in vivo. We have addressed this question by quantitating the relative abundance of specific mRNAs for collagen types I, III, and IV, and laminin in purified populations of hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and lipocytes from normal and fibrotic rat liver. In normal liver, type I collagen gene expression was minimal in all cell types; mRNA for types III and IV collagen were apparent in endothelial cells and lipocytes, but not in hepatocytes. Laminin mRNA was present in all cell types. Induction of fibrogenesis by either bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration was associated with a substantial increase in mRNA for types I and III collagen in nonparenchymal cells. Lipocytes from fibrotic animals exhibited a greater than 30-fold increase in type I collagen mRNA relative to normal lipocytes, and greater than 40-fold relative to hepatocytes. Type III collagen mRNA reached 5 times that in normal lipocytes and greater than 120 times that in hepatocytes. Endothelial cells exhibited an isolated increase in type I collagen mRNA, reaching five times that in normal liver. Type IV collagen and laminin gene expression were not significantly increased in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis; in fact, mRNA for type IV collagen and laminin decreased by up to 50% in endothelial cells. Despite the pronounced changes that occurred in matrix gene expression in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis, no change was noted in hepatocytes. We conclude that nonparenchymal liver cells, particularly lipocytes, are important effectors of hepatic fibrosis in vivo. ',\n",

We report here the use of the biochemical marker desialylated transferrin to aid in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Conventional biochemical tests used for the detection of chronic alcohol consumption fail to differentiate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients from alcoholic subjects. In addition, even in those alcoholic subjects with alcoholic liver disease in whom biopsy has been performed, it is impossible to differentiate these two disease states on the basis of morphological examination alone. In this study we have examined two new markers of excessive alcohol intake, desialylated transferrin and mitochondrial AST in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in patients consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. All nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients consumed minimal or no alcohol and were diagnosed by morphological criteria based on liver biopsy specimens. Alcoholic subjects were consuming in excess of 80 gm/day ethanol, often with clinical evidence of overt alcoholism. Control subjects included both healthy controls and patient controls with liver diseases unrelated to alcohol. The ratio of desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was elevated only in patients who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, whereas the ratio of mitochondrial AST to total AST (mitochondrial AST/total AST) was not significantly different between alcoholic subjects and patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The sensitivity and specificity for the ratio desialylated transferrin/total transferrin was 81% and 98%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity for the mitochondrial AST/total AST ratio was 92%; the specificity was only 50%, indicating that there were a large number of false-positives.

The CD45 family contains protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity and is expressed in one or more of its isoforms on all lymphohematopoietic cells. Considerable work has focused on CD45 expression by lymphoid cells, but minimal work has involved granulocytes. Granulocytic, or myeloid, cell differentiation is accompanied by a number of morphologic and immunophenotypic changes. This study used flow cytometric and immunocytochemical methods in conjunction with morphologic assessment to investigate the expression of CD45 isoforms during differentiation of normal and malignant granulocytic cells. On normal bone marrow cells, the quantity of surface CD45 did not change during earlier stages but did increase significantly at the terminal stages (bands and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]). CD45RO (the low relative molecular mass [Mr] isoform) was very dimly expressed on immature cells but became increasingly brighter beginning at approximately the myelocyte stage. The high Mr isoform (CD45RA) was virtually absent from the cell surface at all stages. Only a small percentage (3-15%) of PMNs expressed surface CD45RA. However, there was a cytoplasmic pool of each isoform associated with membrane-bound granules found throughout differentiation, with remarkable increases in expression at the terminal stages. In the case of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), most cases expressed surface CD45RA with, or without, CD45RO, regardless of their French-American-British (FAB) classification. This appeared to be a stable process at diagnosis and relapse in individual patients and may therefore serve as a diagnostic aid. The biologic significance of this aberrant expression of CD45RA by malignant cells is unknown but raises important questions regarding the cellular processes of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in normal and malignant cells.

Many animal and, more recently, clinical studies have begun to delineate the real and potential roles of stents. Although the ideal intravascular stent does not exist, it is possible to identify characteristics of the hypothetical ideal stent. Iliac and femoropopliteal arterial applications of metallic stents are reviewed. Stents have proved useful in postangioplasty elastic recoil, in some cases of postangioplasty restenosis, and in angioplasty-induced dissection. Their role in primary angioplasty procedures is still uncertain, although in iliac angioplasty the immediate hemodynamic effects of angioplasty plus stenting are superior to those of angioplasty alone. It is clear that metallic stents have not solved the problem of postangioplasty restenosis, as restenosis still occurs in a significant number of cases. This problem is particularly evident in the femoropopliteal stent procedures, in which angiographic restenosis (more than 50% single diameter stenosis) at 6 months after treatment has occurred in approximately 30% of cases. The existence of poststenting restenosis, which often involves the stented segment, underscores the need for better drug regimens in angioplasty and for better understanding of the intimal fibrocellular proliferative response of the vessel wall to injury. Although potentially very useful, biodegradable stents are still a dream whose realization will demand the development of better materials. ',\n",

Obstruction is a complication of many esophageal diseases, but the morphological changes occurring in the obstructed esophagus are poorly understood. We developed a model of esophageal obstruction in the American opossum, Didelphis virginiana. A nonconstricting band around the gastroesophageal junction led to esophageal distention and tortuosity in the weeks following its placement. Despite a marked increase of the esophageal circumference, the esophageal wall was not thinned, and the circular muscle layer had actually increased its thickness. This was due to an increase in the size of individual smooth muscle cells with proportional increases in the cell surface area and volume. The electron density of hypertrophic smooth muscle cells varied much more than that of normal esophageal smooth muscle cells. As cell size increased, the tissue became more compact and the size of the extracellular space decreased. Also, the extracellular space was filled by an amorphous electron-dense material. Additional changes in the structure of hypertrophic smooth muscle cells included prominent intermediate filaments in the vicinity of thick filaments. There was no difference in the structure of the hypertrophic smooth muscle at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks after placement of the band. The morphological features described here resemble those seen in human esophageal spasm and achalasia of humans and could affect esophageal smooth muscle function. ',\n",

The number of events recorded for each patient varied from 5 to 18 and was a function of the duration and success of AICD testing in each patient. In 82 of 93 (88%) episodes, EEG changes were identified, and occurred an average of 10.2 s after the last normal heart beat. Of these 82, 67 (82%) illustrated slowing and attenuation. However, 15 (18%) of the hemodynamic events showed changes not previously described as indicative of cerebral ischemia: 6 (7%) showed a loss of delta-wave activity and 9 (11%) showed an increase in the amplitude of theta activity. Time to onset of these unusual changes (10.6 and 9.2 s, respectively) was not significantly different from that for EEG slowing and attenuation (10.2 s). Five of the ten subjects showed more than one pattern of EEG change. There was no significant difference in the time to onset of EEG change among individual patients, and neither were there differences in patterns of change associated with particular anesthetic agents. These results indicate that in normothermic, lightly anesthetized individuals, cerebral ischemia may cause changes in EEG pattern other than slowing and attenuation of dominant frequencies.

Activated ras proto-oncogenes contribute to the pathogenesis of many animal and human malignancies. ras proto-oncogenes are generally activated by point mutations within codons 12 or 61, which result in the expression of ras protein (p21) bearing characteristic single amino acid substitutions at the corresponding residues. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the presence of single transforming amino acid substitutions can render normal ras protein immunogenic and, thus, a possible target for T cell-mediated tumor therapy. In initial experiments, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 5 through 16 of p21 containing the transforming substitution of arginine for normal glycine at residue 12. The results demonstrated that class II MHC-restricted T cells which were specific for the peptide could be elicited, and that the peptide-induced T cells could specifically recognize the corresponding intact p21 ras protein. Recognition of p21 ras protein by peptide-specific T cells implies that C57BL/6 APC can process the activated ras protein in a fashion that allows presentation of digested protein by class II MHC molecules in a configuration similar to the configuration with synthetic peptide. Evaluation of the immunogenicity of peptides containing alternative transforming amino acid substitutions of ras protein demonstrated that some, but not all, were immunogenic in individual strains of mice. Therefore, although ras protein-specific T cells can be elicited by immunization with synthetic peptides, not all of the potential ras mutations commonly associated with malignancy may be recognizable by T cells from all individuals.

Eleven patients were heterozygous for the BglI site on PGK, 4 for the BamHI site on HPRT, and 1 patient for both sites. Of these 16 patients, 3 had acromegaly, 4 had Cushing's disease, 7 had hyperprolactinemia, and 2 were clinically nonfunctional. After surgery, morphological study, including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the pathological specimens, allowed a direct comparison between clonality and tumor cell type. Control fresh normal pituitary tissue was found to be polyclonal. The following tumors were monoclonal: all 3 somatotroph adenomas, 4 of 4 lactotroph tumors, 3 of 4 corticotroph cell adenomas, a gonadotroph adenoma, and a nonsecretory adenoma. A mixed plurihormonal adenoma was polyclonal, as were 2 tumors consisting of adenomatous lactotrophs interspersed with nontumorous adenohypophyseal pituitary tissue and one corticotroph adenoma mixed with normal pituitary tissue. Functional pituitary adenomas derived from somatotrophs, corticotrophs, or lactotrophs and nonsecretory tumors are monoclonal in nature, suggesting that somatic cell mutations precede clonal expansion of these cells and play a major role in pituitary tumorigenesis. \",\n",
       " '978': 'Recovery from disturbed colonic transit time after alcohol withdrawal. The effects of alcohol withdrawal on total and segmental transit time were evaluated in 20 chronic alcoholic subjects. After withdrawal, colorectal transit time significantly increased from 24.9 +/- 3.6 to 33.3 +/- 4.5 hours mean +/- SE (P less than 0.01). This was the result of an exclusive increase in rectosigmoid transit time from 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.8 +/- 2.1 hours (P less than 0.001). No variations were found in right or left colon transit time. Distal colonic motility is thus a crucial factor in the genesis of diarrhea in chronic alcoholic subjects. ',\n",
       " '979': 'Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in cats following exposure to infected human bile. The main pancreatic duct epithelium acts as a barrier to the diffusion of molecules from the duct lumen into pancreatic acinar and interstitial tissue. We studied sequential ultrastructural characteristics of the loss of epithelial barrier function in the cat using lanthanum, an electron-opaque tracer, following perfusion of the duct from the tail to the duodenum with infected human bile. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells were found to become permeable to the tracer as early as after 15 min of exposure. Later, there was progressive disintegration of intercellular junctions and epithelial loss. Lanthanum penetrated the duct epithelium exclusively on an intercellular path. Loss of barrier function of the pancreatic duct epithelium was consistently associated with subsequent development of acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis. There was no association between the degree of duct epithelial damage and the severity of acute pancreatitis. Both bile and a suspension of bacteria alone were not harmful to the pancreas. Sequential perfusion produced acute pancreatitis only when at first bile and then the bacterial suspension was perfused. A reversed succession of perfusates produced no morphologic alterations. We conclude: (1) Increased tight junction permeability is an early lesion in acute bile-induced pancreatitis: (2) loss of duct epithelial barrier function is important for the initiation but not for the severity of the inflammation; and (3) bile renders duct epithelial intercellular junctions vulnerable to Escherichia coli bacteria.

Clinical findings included profound bilateral cranial nerve VII palsies and severe dysfunction of cranial nerves IX and X. The neuropathy occurred despite treatment with hemodialysis. The dysphagia completely cleared within two weeks, but at six months a severe bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction persisted. A 22-year-old man undergoing hemodialysis for ethylene glycol-induced renal failure developed bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction 14 days after ingestion.

Forty-one patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of unknown etiology were re-investigated at an average of 91 months after the bleed to determine functional capacity. Nineteen patients were performing at their previous level of work, five were employed part-time, and four could not work due to the SAH. Five patients showed a moderate disability in activities of daily living but were not dependent on help, one patient was severely disabled, and two had died. There was one rebleed. Early prognosis of an unfavorable outcome was possible on the basis of three clinical variables on admission: a history of hypertension, a Hunt and Hess grade of greater than II, and the presence of focal neurological deficits. In addition, the presence of an organic mental syndrome at discharge was identified as a predictive factor for reduced functional capacity later on. Other clinical variables in the acute stage, including sex, age, history of headache, interval between SAH and admission, impaired consciousness, and cognitive deficits, were not related to a limited functional level. Residual neurological deficits and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge were also not predictive of restrictions in global functions evaluated by means of the Karnofsky Performance Scale status at follow-up review.

The interaction of sodium sensitivity and stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity was studied in white and black young adults aged 18-23 years. The cardiovascular response to difficult mental arithmetic was measured before and after 14 days of oral sodium loading (10 g NaCl/day added to the usual diet). A sodium-sensitive blood pressure response occurred in 18.4% of whites and 37.3% of blacks. A significant correlation between blood pressure change and sodium excretion occurred in the sodium-sensitive group (r = - 0.28, p less than 0.01). High sodium intake did not augment blood pressure or heart rate response to the beta-adrenergic-mediated stimulus of mental arithmetic in the population, which was grouped by blood pressure, race, or sodium sensitivity.

A series of four patients with pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, hypoxemia, peripheral eosinophilia, and symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and weakness is reported. Lung tissue obtained in three patients revealed interstitial pneumonitis, small-to-medium-vessel mixed-cell vasculitis, and alveolar exudate of histiocytes and eosinophils. All patients reported ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products at a time when an association between L-tryptophan and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was established. This clinical pattern of pulmonary involvement may be part of the continuum of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The pathophysiology of this syndrome and the relationship with the ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products have not yet been identified. ',\n",

To determine the importance of airway inflammation for the development of late asthmatic reactions, we examined sensitized subjects during late asthmatic reactions induced by exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in the laboratory. Late asthmatic reactions are associated with a transient increase of bronchial responsiveness and, at the same time, with an increase of neutrophils followed by eosinophils, and of LTB4 and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Late asthmatic reactions, increased bronchial responsiveness, and increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, LTB4, and albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage induced by exposure to TDI are all prevented by pretreatment with prednisone but not with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin. Aerosolized steroids (beclomethasone and dexamethasone isonicotinate) completely inhibit late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI, whereas theophylline has a partial, and verapamil, ketotifen, and cromolyn have no protective effect. These results suggest that late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI may be caused by airway inflammation, and that anti-inflammatory steroids should be recommended in the prophylaxis of TDI asthma.

       " '986': \"Disturbances in the cerebral perfusion of human immune deficiency virus-1 seropositive asymptomatic subjects: a quantitative tomography study of 18 cases. Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects. Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%). These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases). MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases. EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases. Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients. These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization. These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection. These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions. This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development. It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy. \",\n",
       " '987': 'Plasma histamine in patients with chronic renal failure and nephrotic syndrome. Plasma histamine concentrations were measured using a commercially available monoclonal antibody radioimmunoassay in 38 patients with nephrotic syndrome, end stage renal failure, those receiving haemodialysis, and those receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis to determine whether histamine may mediate damage to glomerular capillaries and arterial endothelium. Plasma histamine concentrations were significantly increased in all four patient groups when compared with those of controls and were the highest in two patients with pruritus. Raised plasma histamine concentrations in such patients are consistent with the hypothesis that histamine may contribute to the damage to glomerular capillaries and to arterial endothelium. These effects may be relevant to the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and atherosclerosis. Histamine may also contribute to the pathogenesis of pruritus in patients with chronic renal failure.

       " '988': 'The fetus as a patient. Surgical considerations. The diagnosis and treatment of human fetal defects has evolved rapidly over the past decade due to improved fetal imaging techniques and better understanding of fetal pathophysiology derived from animal models. The detection of a fetal anomaly may now lead to a change in the timing of delivery, a change in the mode of delivery, or prenatal treatment. Because most therapeutic maneuvers involve some risk to the fetus and mother, there must be a reasonable expectation that the procedure is feasible, safe, and effective before it can be attempted in humans. This requires reliable information about the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease process, the efficacy of fetal surgical intervention in ameliorating the disease, and the feasibility and safety of the proposed intervention. This paper focuses on the rationale and initial clinical experience with fetal surgery for a variety of life-threatening fetal anatomic defects. ',\n",

We reviewed 35 instillations in 20 patients noting a high (86%) side effect profile consisting of fever, onset of turbid dialysis effluent and/or abdominal pain. SK probably releases fibrin clot containing bacteria, leukocytes and debris from the colonized catheter into the peritoneal cavity causing a \"peritonitis-like syndrome\" of 1 to 3 days duration. Fungal peritonitis occurred after SK in 2 patients. Failure of SK therapy was encountered in Staphylococcus epidermidis infection (p less than 0.05 versus other organisms), which may be related to its protective capsular polysaccharide slime and ability to adhere to plastic prosthetic devices. SK, in this study, was useful treatment in relapsing bacterial peritonitis (50% overall cure) but failed to correct catheter malfunction. ',\n",

Since few data are available on epidemiologic features of Barrett's esophagus in young persons, we reviewed the case records of patients undergoing esophageal biopsies at Children's Hospital, Boston, from 1982 through 1986. There were 1423 esophageal biopsies obtained from 1173 patients, and histological evidence of esophagitis was present in 397 cases; Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 10 patients (0.9% of total and 2.5% of esophagitis cases). Specialized columnar epithelium was present in seven of these 10 patients. The mean age of those with Barrett's epithelium was 19.0 +/- 7.9 years (range 3.7-27 years) compared to 8.7 +/- 6.7 years (range 4 days to 31 years) for all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0001); 80% (8/10) of the Barrett's cases were male compared to 54% of all cases. The relative importance of the possible risk factors was assessed by comparing the 10 patients with Barrett's with the 541 patients that had esophageal biopsies in calendar years 1984-1985. Mental retardation, a risk factor not previously described for young persons with Barrett's esophagitis, was present in 70% (7/10) of the Barrett's patients but in only 15% of all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0002). The frequency of mental retardation was also higher, but not significantly so (P greater than 0.07), in patients with biopsies that were positive for esophagitis (19%) than in those with normal biopsies (14%).

       " '991': 'Nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients. OBJECTIVE--To describe a nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis during four months after June 1989. SETTING--A department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen, seeing about half the patients with AIDS in Denmark. SUBJECTS--73 HIV antibody negative subjects and 60 antibody positive subjects admitted as inpatients during the transmission period of the outbreak (20 June-14 August), of whom 18 (17 with AIDS, one with AIDS related complex), developed cryptosporidiosis. Two further HIV negative subjects (one departmental secretary, one visiting relative) developed cryptosporidiosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cryptosporidia in stool samples, clinical symptoms, CD4 cell count, HIV antigen concentration, chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS--The source of the outbreak was identified as ice from an ice machine in the ward, contaminated by an incontinent, psychotic patient with cryptosporidiosis picking out ice for cold drinks. The mean incubation time was at least 13 days-that is, twice that in HIV-negative patients. Of the 18 patients with AIDS who developed cryptosporidiosis, five recovered, two were symptomless carriers, three died of unrelated causes, and eight died after prolonged diarrhoea. Among the 57 exposed HIV antibody positive inpatients (excluding two patients and the index case with cryptosporidiosis diagnosed elsewhere), significantly more of those who developed symptomatic cryptosporidiosis received oral sulphonamides than those who did not (91%, 10/11 v 48%, 21/44, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--The clinical and epidemiological findings indicate that infection was the consequence of very small inocula. Increased sensitivity to cryptosporidiosis may be an unrecognised side effect of oral sulphonamide treatment in patients with AIDS. ',\n",

The capacity for greater fat absorption relative to carbohydrate absorption in protracted diarrhea of infancy was studied in a developed and a developing country (Buffalo, NY, and Bangkok, Thailand). Fifty patients with protracted diarrhea in the first year of life (defined as liquid stools of more than 20 mL/kg per day with more than a 14-day duration) were randomly assigned to receive either a standard semielemental diet (Pregestimil) or a high-fat semielemental diet that contained 40% more fat. The increased fat was largely in the form of medium-chain triglycerides, with the new diet providing 60% of the fat as medium-chain triglycerides compared with 40% in the standard diet. Tolerance to both diets was good in both studies. Both groups showed adequate weight gain and an improvement in anthropometric and biochemical parameters. The patients receiving the high-fat diet showed no initial weight loss, however, and their weight gain was initiated earlier. Cumulative weight gain was also higher in the group receiving the high-fat semielemental diet. Fecal fat analyses were performed after 1 week of therapy. There was no difference observed in the coefficient of fat absorption between the groups receiving the two formulas, indicating that infants with protracted diarrhea may be able to tolerate a higher fat intake than is normally provided. As carbohydrate intolerance is known to be a complicating factor when using semielemental enteral feeds for infants with protracted diarrhea, a higher-fat semielemental diet may be the most appropriate way to provide adequate caloric intake.

The hospital records of patients treated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a recent 5-year period were reviewed to collect data on factors which may be associated with mortality. Overall mortality was 62%. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25%). Patients at increased risk were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, had initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and/or initial hemoglobin level less than eight on arrival at the ED and delay in beginning surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope, and the amount of blood transfused were largely reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The authors concluded that treating emergency physicians and surgeons have little control over the most important risk factors for mortality after aneurysm rupture, but may improve the prognosis by expediting diagnosis in the ED and surgical therapy.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a well-defined entity among acute leukemia, cytogenetically characterized by a t(15;17) (q22;q11-12) translocation. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) treatment restores cell maturation. We have isolated the first permanent cell line with t(15;17), derived from the marrow of a patient with APL in relapse. The establishment of the cell line, its morphologic, karyotypic, and immunohistochemical features are reported. RA induced cell line maturation. Cells strongly expressed myeloid markers, but also some T-cell markers. Additional karyotypic abnormalities, a 12p rearrangement and the possible presence of a homogeneous staining region (HSR) on 19q+ are discussed both in relation to T-cell (CD2, CD4) and monocyte (CD9) markers, and to the acquired cell growth autonomy.

The psychophysiological responses to two mental stress tests (mental arithmetic and an interactive concentration task) were assessed in 168 unmedicated, male, postinfarction patients 36-69 years old. Patients also completed a standard battery of psychological tests. Psychophysiological responses were generally unrelated to age and education. Comparison of patients scoring high (more than 75%) and low (less than 25%) relative to the normal population on psychological measures indicated that heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental stress tests were significantly greater in those reporting low than in those reporting high neuroticism. The study population was subsequently divided into high, medium, and low cardiovascular responders on the basis of rate-pressure product reactions to the two stress tests. The three cardiovascular response groups did not differ in age, interval between myocardial infarction and stress testing, ejection fraction, incidence of exercise-induced ischemia, or ischemic signs during Holter monitoring. However, the high cardiovascular responders were more likely to manifest possible or definite electrocardiographic signs of ischemia or significant arrhythmia during mental stress testing than were the medium or low cardiovascular responders (50% versus 19.6% and 7%, respectively). High cardiovascular responders also reported lower levels of trait anxiety, neuroticism, psychophysiological symptoms, and depression. ',\n",

With the rapidly increasing average age of the population of the Western world, care and treatment of the elderly are becoming increasingly important. Cardiovascular diseases are major causes of death and disability in the elderly; hence, identification of cardiovascular risk factors and effective treatment are essential. Evidence indicates that these risk factors in the elderly are similar to those in the young; namely, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, hyperfibrinogenemia, obesity, and cigarette smoking. The latter two relate to general patient management, whereas the remainder can be significantly influenced by modern drug therapy such as celiprolol. This drug is a third-generation highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with beta 2-agonist and vasodilatory activity giving a unique and advantageous pharmacologic profile for antihypertensive therapy with particular benefits for the elderly.

Although dyspnea is often considered a single sensation, alternatively it may encompass multiple sensations that are not well explained by a single physiologic mechanism. To investigate whether breathlessness experienced by patients represents more than one sensation, we studied 53 patients with one of the following seven conditions: pulmonary vascular disease, neuromuscular and chest wall disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients were asked to choose descriptions of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a dyspnea questionnaire listing 19 descriptors. Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings among the chosen descriptors. We found that patients could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness. In addition, we found an association between certain groups of descriptors and specific conditions producing dyspnea. These findings concur with those in an earlier study in normal volunteers in whom dyspnea was induced by various stimuli. We conclude that different types of dyspnea exist in patients with a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Furthermore, different mechanisms may mediate these various sensations. ',\n",
